      <description>I have ported the Wordpress site to Hugo, an excellent static site generator. In the process I have also hosted it on GitHub Pages, at https://thejare.github.io/. Some posts will be badly formatted, or missing related files.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: I think the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gdcvault.com/free/gdc-14&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GDC Vault&lt;/a&gt; has been updated with all available content, so you may want to go there instead. See you next year!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get&amp;#8217;em while they&amp;#8217;re fresh! If you know of stuff missing here, please tell me about it on Twitter &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/TheJare&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;@TheJare&lt;/a&gt;. You can also check industry sites like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamasutra.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gamasutra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.polygon.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Polygon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.develop-online.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Develop&lt;/a&gt; for ongoing coverage, and hopefully a lot of these materials will show up in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gdcvault.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GDC Vault&lt;/a&gt; soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Firedemo 20th anniversary</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been nearly 20 years since we released that old fire effect and the demoscene turned out to love it. I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iguanademos.com/Jare/files/Fire/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ported it to HTML5&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started when we bought a math coprocessor for our &lt;sup&gt;386&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; and I started playing with fractals and plasmas. A few programming mistakes later, this thing came out and looked neat, so we slapped JCAB&amp;#8217;s VT player and released it. Eternal gratitude to Jester of Sanity for unknowingly lending me his fantastic &lt;a href=&#34;http://mod.haxor.fi/Jester/mod.elysium&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;#8216;Elysium&amp;#8217; mod&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; it didn&amp;#8217;t take me long to learn that such acts were VERY badly frowned upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/TheJare/FiredemoHTML5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;source code on github&lt;/a&gt; if you are so inclined. The comments are slightly better this time! This version runs rather slowly on Chrome, and I don&amp;#8217;t really know why, but IE, Firefox (Win and Android) and iOS Safari work great.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s that time of the year again, when everyone else is partying and having fun (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2013/03/27/really-igda-party-at-gdc-brings-on-the-female-dancers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;or maybe not &amp;#8211; WTF IGDA?&lt;/a&gt;) at GDC in San Francisco. I&amp;#8217;ll try to collect any links to lecture materials I come across.

      <title>Improv math</title>
      <link>https://thejare.github.io/2013/03/improv-math/</link>

      <guid>https://thejare.github.io/2013/03/improv-math/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I always loved math and it was one of my favourite subjects during school. I have to thank my dad and my bro for instilling that love in my head. My young self was always baffled by how most people around me not only hated math, but they seemed to have a hard time with it. How could it be hard? It was all logical, you hardly needed to work or memorize anything because, hey, with just a few basics in your head you could deduce any formulas or theorems you needed during an exam, right? Heh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I&amp;#8217;m one of the tutors for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.u-tad.com/masteres-2/programacion-videojuegos/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Master on Game Programming&lt;/a&gt; at the U-Tad. The subject I&amp;#8217;m teaching this course is Game Architecture: Game Objects, Main Loop and Timing, Reading &amp;amp; Saving, etc. This is the Master&amp;#8217;s debut year, so while I believe the course is going great (and students seem to agree so far), some bits and pieces are not ideal and will need improvement for the following years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them is, unsurprisingly, math.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in my 2nd year in college (1990), I took a half year course on functional programming. Back then, having several years of heavy duty Z80 assembly &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-dust&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;videogames &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://computeremuzone.com/ficha.php?id=281&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;programming&lt;/a&gt;, and being recently introduced to high level languages via Pascal and Modula 2, my brain was very fresh and open to new paradigms and ideas. Structured languages like Pascal and C were a great way to remove some of the tedium and bureaucracy of assembly, but functional was mindblowing. I already understood the idea of passing functions around as parameters, since we did a lot of that in our semi-OOP approach to game character behaviour. But when you create your first infinite list, wow, that&amp;#8217;s a moment to remember!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had the honor to give a presentation at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://spainjs.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SpainJS&lt;/a&gt; Javascript conference in Madrid, on the topic of Videogames and Javascript. I wasted a lot of time preparing a dynamic HTML5 page for my deck of slides, which was my excuse to play with CSS 3d transitions and fancy formatting. You can see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://iguanademos.com/Jare/docs/html5/SpainJS2012/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dynamic deck&lt;/a&gt; (which needs Chrome/Firefox or a similarly decent browser), the &lt;a href=&#34;http://iguanademos.com/Jare/docs/html5/SpainJS2012/#all&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;static deck&lt;/a&gt; (should work everywhere), a &lt;a href=&#34;http://iguanademos.com/Jare/docs/html5/SpainJS2012/spainjs.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; I converted using &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/u/thejare/p/overview-of-javascript-in-games&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Speakerdeck&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JmYAVjm1c&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy!

      <description>A few months ago I created a Github account to see what it&amp;#8217;s all about. Even if you use it yourself without all the nice features of a distributed version control system, it&amp;#8217;s a great way to manage &amp;amp; publish your open source projects!
I put up there some of my old C/C++ code, and a few experiments I&amp;#8217;ve toyed with in my (now scarce) spare time, mostly related to JavaScript.</description>

      <guid>https://thejare.github.io/2012/03/metro-and-javascript/</guid>
      <description>On Facebook I wrote a bunch of thoughts on the fact that Windows 8 treats JavaScript as a first-class citizen for native Metro apps. It was triggered by this and a few other related reads on WinJS.
In general, there is value in having a single language available for all your needs and platforms even if it&amp;#8217;s not 100% portable (look at C/C++). JavaScript is the most widely available language today and, while ugly, the popularity of runtimes like NodeJS and the myriad HTML5 mobile app wrappers like PhoneGap prove that it is viable.</description>

      <title>Facebook IPO and Mobile Social Games</title>
      <link>https://thejare.github.io/2012/02/facebook-ipo-and-mobile-social-games/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2012 02:45:34 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://thejare.github.io/2012/02/facebook-ipo-and-mobile-social-games/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook&amp;#8217;s IPO has been announced, and this means lots of details on Facebook financials have become public. The most interesting bits for social game developers (in VERY broad terms):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost all revenue from Facebook Credits is generated by games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zynga makes up 80% of the total Facebook Credits revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In broad numbers, on Facebook, Zynga has MAU equal to 1.5x all other game devs combined. But Zynga&amp;#8217;s FB Credits revenue is 4x. That&amp;#8217;s an idea of how much better Zynga is at getting players to pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of Facebook&amp;#8217;s revenues come form advertising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook mobile gaming is in its infancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Half of Facebook users use the site via mobile, and this percentage is growing very quickly, but Facebook does not monetize them with games nor advertising.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>node.js</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;cdoral in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iguanademos.com/Jare/wp/?p=2385#comment-3491&#34;&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt; mentions &lt;a href=&#34;http://nodejs.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt;. I have been following this project for a while so I thought I&amp;#8217;d write a little blurb about it and include a few links for further and more in-depth information. Coincidentally, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://nodesummit.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Node Summit&lt;/a&gt; was held this week in SF, so there may be interesting and fresh material coming from there soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First things first: I have played with node.js for little experiments but haven&amp;#8217;t yet found an opportunity to put it to real, production use. Version 0.6 addressed some of my questions about its capabilities and performance, and it is already being used on production servers for many traffic-heavy sites like eBay or LinkedIn, so it&amp;#8217;s clearly gone beyond the experimental stage. If you are building a web service today, node.js is a technology you should consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Node is a stand-alone executable that will run a JavaScript file passed on the command line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;node app.js&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your JavaScript program can use the standard JavaScript libraries (Math, etc) and a bunch of node-specific libraries. In most cases, your program will enter an infinite event loop and start receiving, processing and responding to network requests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unity3D 3.5 Developer preview is out</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And it includes a fancy exporter to Flash11 / Stage3D. All of a sudden, the best way to author advanced Flash content is Unity, not Flash. Considering that Adobe makes their money from Flash tools rather than the plugin, it&amp;#8217;s a really odd situation. With the current outlook of Flash after the &amp;#8216;&lt;a href=&#34;http://creativecodingpodcast.com/?p=140&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Flashmageddon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;, it&amp;#8217;s hard to say how relevant this will be in the long term, but it&amp;#8217;s an impressive feature! And the obligatory cube to celebrate it:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our little one loves to grab anything shiny, but is especially attracted to LCD screens of any type. He loves the netbook, the MacBook, my desktop&amp;#8217;s dual monitors, and of course the big TV, but most of all he loves the iPhone. I often activate the camera in reverse mode and let him play with it, but there&amp;#8217;s always been a problem: while he manipulates the phone, he will push some control or other and stop the camera, go to the desktop and start pushing random icons. I was wishing for some sort of &amp;#8216;baby mode&amp;#8217; where something neat would be happening on the screen, but controls would be disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to use the Sunday morning to dust off my Canvas, CSS and JavaScript skills to code, with Alba&amp;#8217;s design input and feedback, a little BabySaver that could keep his attention with bright colors, and be impossible to quit for him. &lt;a title=&#34;Colors BabySaver&#34; href=&#34;http://www.iguanademos.com/Jare/temp/html5/BabySavers/Colors/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to see its current form. Click on the &amp;#8220;Endless&amp;#8221; button to enable interactions, otherwise any clicks will take you to my homepage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Text Editors</title>
      <link>https://thejare.github.io/2011/12/text-editors/</link>

      <guid>https://thejare.github.io/2011/12/text-editors/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Programmers spend most of our time in front of a text editor. Whether it is a standalone editor, or one integrated in an IDE, that&amp;#8217;s just what we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in MS-DOS days, my editor of choice was &lt;a title=&#34;QEdit&#34; href=&#34;http://www.semware.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;QEdit&lt;/a&gt;, later renamed to The Semware Editor. I loved its configurability, and remapped pretty much everything in it to suit my preferences. Around that time I was also working on Unix systems and used vi there, although only for short editing sessions. I had been exposed to &lt;a title=&#34;Emacs&#34; href=&#34;http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; multiple times (starting with MicroEmacs on the Atari ST), but I could never get comfortable with its crazy keyboard combos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Windows 95 came and became my regular environment, the best choice was &lt;a title=&#34;Ultraedit&#34; href=&#34;http://www.ultraedit.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ultraedit&lt;/a&gt;. Very soon, Microsoft Visual Studio became the compiler and IDE of choice for Win95 development, and its built-in editor proved quite powerful, so I would use Ultraedit for editing files that were not C++.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a couple of Gamasutra &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdamSaltsman/20111018/8685/Contrivance_and_Extortion_InApp_Purchases__Microtransactions.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AdamSaltsman/20111020/8703/Contrivance_and_Extortion_II_Clarifications_Feedback__Suggestions.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;, Adam Saltsman (of &amp;#8216;Canabalt&amp;#8217; fame) ranted against what he feels are &amp;#8216;evil&amp;#8217; game design systems. I characterized his arguments as &amp;#8216;hysterical&amp;#8217;, which is perhaps a bit unfair since rants are meant to be hot. Anyway, at some point I felt compelled to write a long reply, and I&amp;#8217;m reposting it here. I&amp;#8217;ve edited it only slightly, so it&amp;#8217;s possible that some of it is confusing outside of the context of the original discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My guidelines are not for gamers; they&amp;#8217;re for humans. My guidelines are not about styles of game or difficulty of game; they&amp;#8217;re about treating players with a modicum of respect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we agree that all players and all humans should be treated with respect. But there is no inherent lack of respect in ensuring that your game encourages players to pay if they like the game and want to enjoy more of it. If anything, you are asking players to respect YOU as a creator by paying something for the enjoyment they derive from your work. Short of a pure donation model, this encouragement must affect the product you create in some ways. That doesn&amp;#8217;t make the creator greedy, which seems to be Adam&amp;#8217;s characterization of the monetization process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stage3D Vertex Buffer formats</title>
      <link>https://thejare.github.io/2011/10/stage3d-vertex-buffer-formats/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2011 02:00:59 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://thejare.github.io/2011/10/stage3d-vertex-buffer-formats/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you played with the Stage3D spinning cube sample I linked in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iguanademos.com/Jare/wp/?p=2480&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, you will notice one thing: the vertex colors in the vertex buffer are given as 3 floats (red, green and blue). This is rather wasteful in most cases because color components often vary between 0.0 and 1.0, and it&amp;#8217;s more efficient to specify vertex colors (including alpha) as a single 32-bit value. For example, in hexadecimal notation, 0xFF800040 would mean alpha of 1.0 (0xFF), blue 0.5 (0x80), green 0 (0x00) and red 0.25 (0x40).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look in the Stage3D docs, you will find the constant &lt;strong&gt;Context3DVertexBufferFormat.BYTES_4&lt;/strong&gt; to use in the call to &lt;strong&gt;Context3D.setVertexBufferAt()&lt;/strong&gt;. But if you naively just change the vertex buffer array to turn each vertex color&amp;#8217;s set of 3 components into a single hex value, make &lt;strong&gt;dataPerVertex&lt;/strong&gt; = 4 instead of 6, and use &lt;strong&gt;BYTES_4&lt;/strong&gt; for va1, then you will find that the colors are coming out wrong. Why? Because the function &lt;strong&gt;VertexBuffer3D.uploadFromVector()&lt;/strong&gt; always stores the values from the Vector in &lt;em&gt;floating point format&lt;/em&gt;. Of course! This is the most common situation for the components of the vertex positions, normals, texture coordinates and such. But we need our &lt;strong&gt;BYTES_4&lt;/strong&gt; color value to be stored verbatim as a 32-bit uint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vector.&lt;Number&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;uploadFromVector()&lt;/strong&gt; do not give you control over the byte format of value. How do you solve this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Flash Stage 3D is out!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, Adobe released to the masses a new version of their Flash Player, and an updated SDK. The biggest change (for me at least) is the inclusion of hardware-accelerated 3D, known as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/stage3d.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Stage3D&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;#8217;s a quick tour of what I did to compile and run my first Stage3D program (Windows 7 PC but should be applicable everywhere). Useful because the Adobe site is not really clear about this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>I have been playing around with HTML5, Canvas and WebGL. Not a lot to show for it, but at least I forced myself to write a bit again. Check it out here if you&amp;#8217;re curious, and good luck reaching a score of 150 on Lesson 5!
By the way, for some reason Firefox has started to run Lesson 5 rather slow in both my PCs. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure it used to be a rock solid 60 fps back when I wrote the game, but at some point either upgrading past Firefox 5, or upgrading to Windows 7, has made it slow.</description>

      <description>I may be getting interested in writing stuff again with more depth and detail, appropriate (even if small) audience, and with clearer ownership than social networks provide. Twitter is cool as a sort of RSS aggregator; Facebook has become intrusive, annoying and just generally inadequate for anything but on-the-fly photo and YouTube sharing; and Google+ has flatlined. In preparation for more writing, I have added a WordPress blog to my site, because my old blog system was fun to write but boring to maintain and extend.</description>

      <description>Time for that old laptop to receive Ubuntu 11.04!
Er&amp;#8230;
Apparently, the graphics card is too old to run the fancy new Unity UI. Ah well, in any case, it&amp;#8217;s a good idea to have a working Linux machine.
Then, the same problem as before. And I hate myself for not detailing precisely what I did to speed up the HDD. I need to fix this ASAP because the system has started doing massive checks to update packages and the machine is completely unusable.</description>

      <description>I wrote a minimalistic photo gallery for my wife. It&amp;#8217;s a quick mix of php and MySQL on the server, css/html page, and some Javascript+jQuery for a still unfinished slideshow function.
The layout spec was:
&amp;#8211; left-side navigation column
&amp;#8211; picture to the right of the navigation, with a title centered underneath
&amp;#8211; work with pictures of varying sizes
&amp;#8211; a screen-wide footer
&amp;#8211; as little else as possible
I wanted to make it as friendly as possible to screen sizes and form factors, so that even in the smallest or weirdest screen, you would see as much of the picture as possible.</description>

      <description>In the previous post, I made references to MySQL but didn&amp;#8217;t say anything about a quick local setup. So here&amp;#8217;s what I did for mine:
&amp;#8211; Download MySQL binaries from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/. I chose the huge 64-bit Zip archive.
&amp;#8211; I unzipped the /bin/, /data/, /docs/ and /share/english/ folders into my destination MySQL folder. Then I deleted all the *.pdb files.
&amp;#8211; Start the server via start mysqld. You can later stop it with mysqladmin.</description>

      <description>Since I started working on Pyro&amp;#8217;s server backend for its social games, I have grown to love the nginx web server. Compact, efficient and fully featured, it&amp;#8217;s a great alternative to Apache if you are in full control of your web server and apps.
A few days ago nginx came of age with the release of 1.0, so I did a refresh of my simple web dev setup at home:</description>

      <description>Well not exactly, Linux distributions these days are much more organized and documented than in the wild west days before 1.0 hit. But I have installed Ubuntu Desktop 10.04 on my old Laptop, a 7-year old thing with 512Mb RAM, some Centrino CPU and a slow-ass ATI 9200.
Windows XP on that laptop had slowed down noticeably over time, especially since I installed an antivirus, but back in the day it was a decent PC.</description>

      <description>Hey gang,
I have inserted Google&amp;#8217;s reCAPTCHA widget to validate user registration.
The Captcha is a bit annoying right now because pressing Enter after typing it in will default to Login rather than Register, forcing you to manually click on the button. I think I don&amp;#8217;t really need two separate buttons anymore, so I may fix that soon.
I&amp;#8217;ll probably wipe the user database because by now everyone who ever posted here may have forgotten their password.</description>

      <description>Dismayed to find out that MSN&amp;#8217;s and Skype 4.2&amp;#8217;s lack of a proper tray icon in Windows 7 is by design. According to this: &amp;ldquo;This icon pattern is no longer recommended for Windows 7. Use regular taskbar buttons instead if your program has desktop presence.&amp;rdquo;
I think the taskbar is not the right place for icons that we use very rarely, but what do I know&amp;#8230; For now the best approach if you don&amp;#8217;t like this feature is to set the programs to run on Vista SP2 compatibility mode; in the long run I guess I&amp;#8217;ll just have to get used to it.</description>

      <description>Hey!
Yeah I&amp;#8217;m still alive, and so is the site. For some reason, posting here got completely sidetracked, I guess I just ended up doing my &amp;ldquo;social updates&amp;rdquo; via Facebook instead. I don&amp;#8217;t know if that&amp;#8217;s going to really change, so no promises.
Whew, 2009 flew by and what a great year it was. Then 2010 came with some surprises early on: Activision laid off my entire team at Radical. I was already considering coming back to Spain after finishing the project, so this just sped things up.</description>

      <description>I recently watched Coraline, a charming fairytale. I was mildly excited to see it in 3D and find out what all the craze was about. Back in the 80&amp;#8217;s I watched Jaws 3D using the same technology, and being less than impressed after the first 3 or 4 gimmicks.
The result? I liked Coraline but didn&amp;#8217;t enjoy the experience. I found the 3D distracting at times, and generally tiring. This article describes many of these symptoms and possible causes much better than I can try.</description>

The Universidad Complutense team is organizing a Game Jam in Madrid around the end of January 2009. Check it out! It&amp;#8217;s the same people who organized the Master in Games Programming with which I collaborated as a tutor a few years ago, so I know you will be in good hands. (thanks Bak, I had totally missed this one)

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been playing lately:
LEGO Batman: Just like all the other LEGO games. Funny, forgiving and with tons of stuff to do on the side. I love the idea of playing the missions from the point of view of the heros and then the villains.
Braid: Irritating but creative and ultimately very rewarding. Most of the puzzles have relatively easy to execute solutions, but they can be hard to figure out, while the more obvious solutions are jolly hard to do.</description>

      <description>After the Activision Blizzard merger thing, a lot of people have been laid off at Radical Entertainment, but thankfully I&amp;#8217;m not one of them. I wish the best of lucks to those who are no longer in the company, and I hope they land on their very capable and knowledgeable feet.
When the final details of the layoffs were announced, I was on holidays in Alaska. It&amp;#8217;s weird to be hiking, trying to catch sight of a bear or moose, and generally having a great time, while you know that at that precise moment you may be losing your job.</description>

Loot in WoW is a grind to get, Titan Quest hadn&amp;rsquo;t done it for me, AoC didn&amp;rsquo;t even register, Robokill is nice but small, and I am fighting the urge to buy the Diablo 2 battlechest. But then I remembered that the Too Human demo was coming out soon. Today, in fact.
I like what they were trying to do with the game, I like it a lot.</description>

      <description>Age of Conan came out, a promising MMO from veterans Funcom. It promised gore, nudity, great graphics and a few twists to the classic MMORPG genre. Even though it delivered in those areas, the game is way too buggy, unfinished and, well, unpolished. I reached level 43 and stopped playing. As a developer, I can endure normal bugs, but there&amp;#8217;s just not enough variety in the game to make me want to play further.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I updated this, so let&amp;#8217;s at least recap a few movies I&amp;#8217;ve seen lately. From better to worse:
In Bruges: Unique film full of strange situations and unforgettable characters and dialog. Despite being so weird, it still manages to be very entertaining.
Charlie Wilson&amp;#8217;s War: interesting characters and excellent dialogs in a very entertaining and thought-provoking movie. Very good acting except for Julia Roberts, who for some reason is not believable at all in her role.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s out, and it&amp;#8217;s fantastic! Finishing the game is relatively easy even for old farts like me, but the point of the game is killing with style, variety and effectiveness. The game&amp;#8217;s biggest flaw is that it repeats a lot of content, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t feel too repetitive to me because it&amp;#8217;s the fun of fighting that matters.
They pulled off a tough feat when more than half of the game is played with a new character instead of our beloved Dante, and that character doesn&amp;#8217;t suck!</description>

      <description>The wonderful Rez is back on XBox Live, and it looks and sounds absolutely glorious. Even though the game has an hypnotic and relaxing quality, my right thumb hurts, and with Devil May Cry 4 next week that&amp;#8217;s just the beginning. 🙂</description>

      <title>Political commentary in FPS games? No thanks</title>

      <description>A few monhts ago in Gamasutra, Harvey Smith described the intriguing elements of social and political subversion in his shooter Blacksite: Area 51. The game apparently turned out to be crap, but I never got to try it. Now Gamasutra again introduces us to another contender for &amp;ldquo;politically conscious FPS games&amp;rdquo; in the form of Turning Point: Fall of Liberty. From the horrible demo just released, this game is even worse.</description>

      <description>JJ Abram&amp;#8217;s latest baby is here, after months of speculation generated by last summer&amp;#8217;s trailer and an Internet viral campaign. It&amp;#8217;s basically a Godzilla-like monster movie shown through the eyes of a guy&amp;#8217;s camcorder. There are many reports of people feeling sick and even throwing up thanks to the savage shaky-cam work. I certainly saw way more people getting up and out of the theater than in any other movie I remember (except for Vatel, but that&amp;#8217;s a different story).</description>

      <description>And a happy New Year to everyone!
It&amp;acute;s good to be in Spain for a couple of weeks, see the family, friends, and of course have plenty of tapas and fun.
Yesterday I went to watch Michael Clayton, an excellent directorial debut by writer Tony Gilroy. He was clearly influenced by producer Steven Soderbergh&amp;#8217;s style: slow pace, complex storytelling and heavy emphasis on character development. One of the best movies this year.</description>

      <description>A few days ago Dr Petter released a little tool to generate simple sound effects for hobby game developers. &amp;ldquo;An MS Paint for sound effects…&amp;rdquo; as he puts it himself. It&amp;#8217;s certainly no SoundForge, but lots of fun to play with, and more than capable for many quick projects.</description>

      <description>Ok, this is really cool. Passage is a sort of artsy-fartsy game that&amp;#8217;s supposed to make you think and all that, rather than entertain.
Jokes aside, it is a really interesting experiment. It&amp;#8217;s not pretty, it&amp;#8217;s not even fun, but it certainly touches some of the ways in which a game can speak about us, both the author and the players. You should play it without reading any instructions, just&amp;#8230; well, like creator Jason Roher says, fire it up and play it.</description>

Independent Games Festival finalists. Some great-looking stuff there (with interesting emphasis on rhythm games), and some are freely available. Best of lucks to all of them!</description>

      <description>Some good stuff coming from there, but from all the coverage I have had access to, this talk by Jonathan Blow is the most interesting (and complete &amp;#8211; audio and slides included). A bit incomplete in the sense that it doesn&amp;#8217;t address the need for commercial games to work as commercial products, but commercial viability is not his point anyway.
For some time I have held the belief that games have a hard time as meaningful forms of expression, because the kind of activity and instant-to-instant attention they require tends to overwhelm the mind and distract from what could be meaningful in them.</description>

      <description>The beta is out, so I dusted off my test project and checked it out.
The transition was fairly painless, and the great news is that it works with Visual Studio 2005. No more of that Express crap! (to be fair, VC# Express is quite good for the price)
I was curious about the Content Pipeline stuff since I had never touched it before, so I set out to prepare a custom Model processor that would extract more detailed material parameters from the source art, including a property to specify a specific fx shader / effect.</description>

      <description>Gas Powered Games have released a patch that removes the SecuROM copy protection crap from Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance. The game was released this week, so the patch has taken less than 4 days to arrive. Another game to add to the neverending pile!
I also bought a PS3. I knew I would get one sooner or later, and with the recent price discounts and Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank now out, there just wasn&amp;#8217;t any reason to delay the inevitable.</description>

      <description>At last the chaps at Mercury Steam have released their baby. Gore, guts, twisted demons and tortured souls, the kind of stuff you would expect from Clive Barker. NOT subtle. 🙂
Reviews and fan response so far are quite spread, with a few reviews totally panning the game, a few loving it, and pretty much everything in between. Why? Well, because the game really IS a lot of different things. I&amp;#8217;ll tell you what I think.</description>

It&amp;#8217;s only been active for a few days and it already has over 5K entries, but in practice most conversations still feel very short (do the math). If you are curious, the author is commenting on the process in a forum thread.</description>

      <description>I hate them. I run some application, and instead of letting me work right away, it decides to pop up and invariably tell me something I already know. My mind is already anticipating the first steps that I&amp;#8217;m going to perform, and that flow is abruptly interrupted by the need to push that evil &amp;ldquo;Close&amp;rdquo; button. I normally choose to disable it immediately. However, sometimes there may be useful stuff lurking in there, but I never get to revisit them.</description>

EBGames: &amp;ldquo;We only got a few copies and they sold out. Maybe in a few days.&amp;rdquo;
HMV: &amp;ldquo;Our order hasn&amp;#8217;t arrived yet.&amp;rdquo;
Interesting launch for a Game Of The Year contender. 360 version BTW.
Edit: As a consolation, Puzzle Quest if finally out in XBLA. It&amp;#8217;s a fantastic game.
Well, found a copy in Best Buy, and played through the regular Portal missions.</description>

      <description>Unless you are hiding under a rock, or your name is trace, you probably know that Halo 3 has just been released with the hopes of becoming the fastest selling game ever. Regardless what you think of the game or the series, you will probably agree that this video is quite funny. I won&amp;#8217;t be playing the game until next week, but I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to it.
A demo of Crash of the Titans from Radical is also available for the 360.</description>

      <description>I finally bought a Wii, so I&amp;#8217;m playing Super Paper Mario (thanks Houmi!). Very entertaining, although the switching to 3D thing becomes more a gimmick as you play. Still, very imaginative maps and characters.
I also bought Blue Dragon on the 360, and I&amp;#8217;m impressed. This thing is HUGE, I can see in excess of 40 hours to complete the main story, and god knows how much more for the side quests.</description>

      <description>Trace wants to know less about the games I play, and more about the games I work on. 🙂 I joined Radical Entertainment to work on the Advanced Technology Group (known as ATG). We create the technology (the &amp;ldquo;Titanium&amp;rdquo; engine) that all game teams at Radical use to create their games. Radical&amp;#8217;s ability to make that happen was one of the things that attracted me here. As I learn more about how they got to this point, I realize that it has been far from easy, but it&amp;#8217;s not an impossible task like *ahem* previous experiences might suggest.</description>

      <description>Bioshock is really good. It&amp;#8217;s not perfect, but it does so many things so well, that it has won a place in my &amp;ldquo;best games of the past few years&amp;rdquo; list. I&amp;#8217;m close to the end now, and I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that I won&amp;#8217;t play it again after I&amp;#8217;m done&amp;#8230; but the very fact that I asked myself that question should be quite telling. The only modern games that I replayed immediately after finishing (normally at a higher difficulty) have been&amp;#8230; Commander Keen, Doom, Quake, Quake2, Return to Castle Wolfenstein (see a pattern?</description>

      <description>Grrrrr.
The game is good, but (a) subtitles are still heavily desynched like in the demo, and (b) save often, or you risk wasting lots of time when it crashes. I have 1:30 to replay. 🙁 This is on 360, so I can&amp;#8217;t blame the drivers.</description>

There&amp;#8217;s a lot of repetition, but it does bring home the point that XNA and C# can be useful even for professional developers today, and will most certainly become more useful in the future. I have only done a couple of minor experiments with XNA 1.</description>

      <description>By now I have finally accepted that I don&amp;#8217;t like them. What&amp;#8217;s a &amp;ldquo;smart shooter&amp;rdquo;? A First Person Shooter type of game where the emphasis is more on atmosphere and story (the environment in which you do things) than on raw gameplay (the things you actually do). The classic examples were System Shock 1 &amp;amp; 2&amp;#8230; I tried SS1 and had zero fun with it. The story bits and character progression in SS2 kept me hooked for about 2 hours, but at that point the cruddy combat just got to me.</description>

      <description>Despite a number of oddities, Sunshine is the best Science-Fiction movie in many years. Visually stunning, excellent music, and a story with a lot of personality despite being essentially a mish-mash of sci-fi topics already used in previous movies.
The commercial success of this movie is doomed due to the strange way in which distributors have handled it, with late and staggered releases and a marketing campaign that tells too much.</description>

      <description>The Darkness: it&amp;#8217;s fun, it&amp;#8217;s creepy, it&amp;#8217;s quite good. The 360 version looks way better than what I remember of the short PS3 testdrive I did a few weeks ago. Cutscene animations are very stiff.
Tomb Raider Legend: I finally sat down to play it through to the end. Very good platforming and puzzles, simplistic combat, and weird bosses with pretty bad (accelerated?) animations. Quite nice overall, and great value at $19.</description>

      <description>Voodoo Extreme has collected a fantastic index of coverage and trailers from E3. I suppose the new E3 format sucks for game fans and small/hobby game sites and bloggers, but looks much better and useful for developer and publishers doing actual work. As a visitor I&amp;#8217;ll miss the old E3, as a developer I think I won&amp;#8217;t.
The Transformers movie was exactly as expected: cheesy, long, boring and mostly irrelevant script, fast and erratic editing, saturated colors, and excellent CGI and explosions.</description>

      <title>From zero to&amp;#8230; a f*ng mess</title>

      <description>A week before E3, someone unveils a Circuit City ad with a PS3 announced for $100 less. People speculate of a PS3 price drop. Sony categorically denies. E3 arrives, and Sony formally announces a $100 price drop. Ok, the deny-then-confirm tactic is old and tired, but hey&amp;#8230; the PS3 needs all the help they can get, because they are simply not selling like they should.
E3 goes well for Sony, with a number of interesting exclusive games, and the general impression is that PS3 is going to start taking off.</description>

      <description>Call me a fanboy if you want, but I just came out of the movie theater feeling that Ratatouille is the best animated movie ever made, and one of the best movies of any kind in many years. Script, characters, visual design, animation, rendering technology, pacing, humour&amp;#8230; I absolutely loved all of it. I spent the entire movie with an unmistakable feeling of pure joy in my chest.
It does many things against what we may consider &amp;ldquo;mainstream business sense&amp;rdquo;, from the rat theme, to the french accents and the adult themes in an animated movie&amp;#8230; and it&amp;#8217;s probably going to pay for it with a less than stellar box office.</description>

      <description>I ran into this today with VS2005 SP1: if you define the body of a specialization of a template class&amp;#8217; member function in a separate cpp file, the linker will barf:
 template&amp;lt;class&amp;amp;nbsp;T&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;struct&amp;amp;nbsp;A&amp;amp;nbsp;{&amp;amp;nbsp;void&amp;amp;nbsp;f()&amp;amp;nbsp;{}&amp;amp;nbsp;};&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;template&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;void&amp;amp;nbsp;A&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;::f();&amp;amp;nbsp;//&amp;amp;nbsp;body&amp;amp;nbsp;in&amp;amp;nbsp;a&amp;amp;nbsp;separate&amp;amp;nbsp;cpp&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;void&amp;amp;nbsp;main()&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;{&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;A&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;a;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;a.f();&amp;amp;nbsp;//&amp;amp;nbsp;Linker&amp;amp;nbsp;complains&amp;amp;nbsp;that&amp;amp;nbsp;this&amp;amp;nbsp;function&amp;amp;nbsp;is&amp;amp;nbsp;undefined.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;}
 You have to define the body in all source files (or at least one) that actually use the specialization of that function, normally in the header file:
 template&amp;lt;class&amp;amp;nbsp;T&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;struct&amp;amp;nbsp;A&amp;amp;nbsp;{&amp;amp;nbsp;void&amp;amp;nbsp;f()&amp;amp;nbsp;{}&amp;amp;nbsp;};&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;template&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;void&amp;amp;nbsp;A&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;::f()&amp;amp;nbsp;{&amp;amp;nbsp;}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;void&amp;amp;nbsp;main()&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;{&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;A&amp;lt;int&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;a;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;a.</description>

      <description>No more Vista posts for a while. 🙂
It seems that my bold predictions for the Nintendo Wii were only half right. The Wii is a runaway success (it is still impossible to find one on the shelves here in Vancouver), but in terms of software sales, Nintendo games are the only real sellers for that system. Add to that the impressive numbers for the Nintendo DS.
Meanwhile, the XBox 360 and the especially the PS3 are having a hard time penetrating the market.</description>

Same happens if you type a URL in an Explorer window. This popup only happens if Firefox was not already running. The fix is to remove or rename the registry key:

This key will reappear when Firefox is updated, so you may want to prepare a .</description>

      <description>I know a few people got the Starcraft urge after the SC2 announcement; a couple of them even went and bought it again. I might have done likewise if I didn&amp;#8217;t have Supreme Commander. But this?
Starcraft Battlechest and Warcraft 3 Battlechest up in the top 10 PC sales. The former is 9 years old, the later 5. And of course WoW and its expansion taking the top 2 spots. It&amp;#8217;s just insane.</description>

      <description>If you have never played a Tower Defense game, now is the time to check them out by downloading the demo for Immortal Defense (via Indygamer). I believe this game concept originated as a mod for Starcraft and later Warcraft 3, but it has become a subgenre of strategy games in itself. The idea is simple: place and upgrade static defenses and destroy the incoming enemy waves. Different towers have different abilities, and the amount of enemies can be overwhelming at times, so make the most out of your limited resources!</description>

      <description>I just finished watching the 3rd season&amp;#8217;s finale, and despite having found most of this season fairly uninteresting, I think the finale is among the best endings of a TV series I have ever seen. The finales of Battlestar Galactica&amp;#8217;s 2nd season and Invasion&amp;#8217;s first and only were very good as well, whereas this years&amp;#8217;s Heroes has been a bit meh, 24 was &amp;ldquo;more of the same&amp;rdquo; and BSG was downright terrible.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ll keep it short: the actual game is not so terrible, and all in all it seems a nice update of true Total Annihilation gameplay. I played the first few campaign missions and I found them fairly uninspired: complete some early objectives before the map expands and then decimate a large enemy base. Fun but a bit monotonous.
The only problem that remains is that the game freezes my PC after about 10-20 minutes of playing.</description>

      <description>Unless you are hiding under a rock, you will know by now that Blizzard has officially announced Starcraft 2. Juciy cinematic and gameplay videos are cluttering the Internet, fanboys and detractors heated in dialectic debates about the apparent lack of a difference between this game and the original. Me? I loved the original and I don&amp;#8217;t mind Starcraft 1.5 with a visual upgrade. I don&amp;#8217;t mind that at all. It looks exactly how I hoped it would, nothing more and nothing less.</description>

      <description>David Jaffe (THE God of War creator) just finished a completely different kind of project: casual, downloadable, $10 PS3 game &amp;ldquo;Calling All Cars&amp;rdquo;. Then, Gamespot gave it a 6.7. David didn&amp;#8217;t like it, but apparently something in the reviews (he says the IGN one) made them decide to spend a bit more time fixing some problems. Joystiq made fun of him, and he got really mad.
I like to see game developers voicing opinions, and I have my share of secretly (or not so secretly) hated gaming sites and reviewers&amp;#8230; but when one of our industry&amp;#8217;s best tells a gaming site to just &amp;ldquo;Fuck you, guys.</description>

      <description>This is a trip down memory lane! Jet Pac Reloaded is now available for download in XBox Live Arcade. For those not insanely old, Jet Pac was an 8-bit game released sometime around 1982. I played it on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, and it&amp;#8217;s a very dear game to me for several reasons.
This is the game that distinctly made me want to make games. I was 12 years old, but I used to say &amp;ldquo;someday I will make a Jet Pac&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Games: Can I accomplish this?&amp;rdquo; He also mentions Groundhog Day and Truman Show, both of which are extremely popular among gamers, because they speak about the world in terms that any gamer will recognize.</description>

&amp;ldquo;the European hardware specification for the PlayStation 3 seems to show that the original PlayStation 2 “Emotion Engine” is no longer included, presumably necessitating the new reliance on software emulation for older titles.&amp;rdquo;
I hope Sony&amp;#8217;s own ninjas are up to the task. You can check here for the list of PS2 titles confirmed to work on the European PS3. Oh wait, you can&amp;#8217;t, because there&amp;#8217;s none, and there will be none until the console is out.</description>

Aside from a few bugs and the expected server overloads / crashes, the launch seems to have gone quite smoothly, and most people are loving it (me included!). It is more of the same polished and playable gameplay and content, don&amp;#8217;t expect any radical changes.</description>

The whole thing reminds me of an older post.</description>

      <description>Gamasutra has posted a commented reproduction of the Call of Duty: Their Finest Hour development contract between Sparks Interactive and Activision. This document was made public as part of the legal battle between the two companies. It contains everything: clauses, obligations, warranties, assignment of rights, dates and payments, royalties, key team members &amp;#8211; the whole shebang. Three lawyers comment the details of each section, and what problems they think could arise in the future.</description>

      <description>Designostic, the Spanish game design site, has been recreated as Gameto. It includes a News section along with the Articles, and a lot of new features. The intent of the site creators is to extend its coverage to all aspects of videogame development. I went ahead and submitted a Review of what I consider to be one of the best games of 2006, Lego Star Wars II.</description>

      <description>In the wake of the Slamdance fiasco (6 finalists have already dropped), I&amp;#8217;m ending up checking the entries. I ran into Book &amp;amp; Volume, and thought it might give me new respect for the current state of Interactive Fiction.
After 5 minutes, it&amp;#8217;s only given me despair. It works like a classic text adventure: a bunch of text and a prompt where you write what you want to do. So the game starts: I&amp;#8217;m in a room, there&amp;#8217;s a pager buzzing.</description>

      <description>These past days I&amp;#8217;ve been increasingly interested in the controversy raised by this game, its inclusion and later removal from the roster of finalists of the Slamdance Festival, and the debates the whole thing has created. I won&amp;#8217;t bother linking every piece of the story, as other people have already done so. You can download the game from the Manifesto site, or (given how bad the actual gameplay is) watch a video run of it.</description>

      <description>Excellent article here. Worthy alone for the differentiation between having goals and pushing the player in certain directions. It should be obvious that &amp;ldquo;giving you something to do&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;forcing you to do something&amp;rdquo; do not need to be present together, but I had never thought of that in the context of sandbox and linear games.</description>

      <description>Whereas the visuals for Hard Candy didn&amp;#8217;t totally do it for me, Children of Men is a whole different thing. A very unforgiving look at how our modern society would destroy itself if the reins were let a bit loose. The movie has some problems with pacing and very unlikely resolutions to some situations, but it still well worth watching. The visual design is amazing and (in my opinion) deserves at least an Oscar for Cinematography.</description>

      <description>The good news is that Soul Calibur 2 Xbox is among the new batch of gamessupported by the 360 emulator. The bad news is that only the US version does. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I know that my brother and the other Ninjas keep working their asses to make this stuff happen, but sometimes I think I&amp;#8217;m jinxed. I&amp;#8217;ve never been much into fighting games, but the Soul Calibur was uniquely awesome and still my favourite.</description>

      <description>After all the jabs that Sony threw on Microsoft for being unable to play ALL XBox games in its 360 backcompat emulator, someone decided to check how Sony&amp;#8217;s efforts are much better. This video is the result, and does create serious doubts that anyone will want to play their PS2 games on a PS3. If they work at all, that is, because Sony has a list and even a database of their own.</description>

      <description>Microsoft&amp;#8217;s XNA Games Studio Express 1.0 has been released, opening the door (for a price) to homebrew XBox 360 development. Will it work, or flop like Sony&amp;#8217;s PS1 Yaroze? $100 a year, lack of networking, and the inability of unsubscribed users to run your games are not homebrew-friendly features.</description>

      <description>My 2 sisters and my parents never really understood my brother&amp;#8217;s and my own fixation with videgames. They mostly accepted it, understood it was something that we enjoyed, and at some point they were happy that we made successful (even if a bit rollercoaster-like) careers out of it. The closest thing they got to enjoying a videogame was watching me play Ico.
Marta was sometimes curious about some games when she was much younger, but since then she kind of felt that videogames were a terrible way to waste one&amp;#8217;s spare time.</description>

      <description>So, Scott Miller thinks Valve is not a good route to follow, with quotes like &amp;ldquo;I’m not a big fan of using Steam, because I’m not a fan of a strong competitor of ours having access to our download stats and revenue totals.&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;if Valve doesn’t do well for a game or two, Steam will get cut before their internal game development&amp;rdquo;. Then, the same day, Prey gets released on Steam.</description>

      <description>I finally had a few hours to sit down and play the game through to the end. It is very good, probably the shooter I&amp;#8217;ve enjoyed the most since the original Halo. The technology is brilliant, the levels and firefights are very well designed, and the production is fantastic. It&amp;#8217;s a lot of fun to play, and brings a fresh approach to the genre. It takes a while getting used to the controls, movement and cover-based fighting, but the first Act does a good job of teaching you all of that without being too easy.</description>

      <description>Some people have emailed me to ask if &amp;ldquo;what they have heard&amp;rdquo; is true. Yes, it is: this Christmas I will be leaving Pyro Studios. Unlike other veterans, I&amp;#8217;m staying in the games industry; I have already accepted a job offer outside of Spain, which means I will be doing a lot of packing in a couple months.
Leaving the company at which I have worked hard for the past eight years was a hard decision, but in hindsight it was inevitable.</description>

      <description>I just came back from having dinner with Enric Alvarez, the CEO of Mercury Steam and currently hard at work on Clive Barker&amp;#8217;s Jericho. We shared a roundtable a couple weeks ago in Art Futura, but didn&amp;#8217;t have much time to talk there. Great food and even better conversation. Although it&amp;#8217;s not been easy for such a small studio, they seem to be doing a great job transitioning into the fabled next-gen.</description>

      <description>I sat down today to check out what&amp;#8217;s inside XNA Games Studio, the platform which Microsoft touts as the future of bedroom games coding (well, sort of). It&amp;#8217;s still in beta 2, and it doesn&amp;#8217;t support XBox 360 executables yet, but it works fairly well. I ported my old C# game experiment without much pain, and you can check the results here. Don&amp;#8217;t expect a lot of polish in the code or the actual game: the platform is still beta after all, so I didn&amp;#8217;t want to spend more than a few hours with it.</description>

      <description>After waking up somewhat early, I sat down and tried Defcon by &amp;ldquo;the last of the bedroom coders&amp;rdquo; Introversion Software. The game&amp;#8217;s premise and visuals are fascinating: an RTS about global thermonuclear warfare, with a graphical style borrowed from tactical displays (as seen in movies like the inspirational Wargames).
After a simple and clear tutorial, you can start freeform games in a multiplayer-oriented fashion. There are no campaign or missions, but you can make games versus AI.</description>

      <description>I just watched the movie El Laberinto Del Fauno (Pan&amp;#8217;s Labyrinth), by fantasy film master Guillermo Del Toro. What a wonderful movie! It is a dramatic and at times gruesome fairytale set in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, with stunning visuals and a gripping story. One of the best films of this year, which sadly won&amp;#8217;t get enough worldwide attention due to it being recorded in spanish.</description>

      <description>I just bought Doom on the 360 Live Arcade Marketplace&amp;#8230; Ahh the memories! As a port it&amp;#8217;s quite cheaply done, doesn&amp;#8217;t even properly support 16:9 screens, and they certainly haven&amp;#8217;t touched any gameplay, graphics or features. But the old magic is there: maze-y levels, secrets with disguised hints, cheap scares, and LOTS of baddies to rip apart! Raw, unadulterated gameplay, without catering to mundane things such as &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;realism&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;coherence&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Scott Miller used to praise  online distribution of games, and Triton as the future king of the hill. I guess he was a bit hasty: Triton has apparently shut down operations, and left Prey (and their other games) buyers out in the cold.
This highlights the biggest issue with Digital Rights Management, online distribution, and the concept of consumers having to buy not only the goods, but the right to use them: to what extent should the law bend to protect the sellers, rather than the buyers?</description>

It attacks the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; approach to Agile Development and Extreme Programming, and then moves on to discuss how Google&amp;#8217;s process is vastly superior to anything else.
Obviously, what works for Google may not necessarily work for other companies, other products, and other markets. What company could afford to run a beta for over two years, and not be laughed at?</description>

Kim Pallister also offers some doubts about the Wii pricepoints and launch strategy. I can&amp;#8217;t entirely agree with the specifics, but I do with the overall idea that perhaps a bit more agressive pricing might help a lot. We&amp;#8217;ll see in a few months.</description>

      <description>Wow, the final details on Nintendo Wii&amp;#8217;s launch came out this week, and the gaming world seems to be less than impressed. Every final number is at the high end of the bracket people were considering &amp;ldquo;reasonable&amp;rdquo;. In Europe:
&amp;#8211; 250 euros for the console (Wii Sports included)
&amp;#8211; 40e for extra wiimote + 20e for extra nunchuck
&amp;#8211; games priced between 50e and 60e
&amp;#8211; release in December so if the console is a success you might have trouble getting one for xmas.</description>

      <description>The folks over at shmup-dev have started a new competition to develop a 2D shooter with the rule that there must be some form of weapon autofire. Considering that this feature is extremely common, it&amp;#8217;s safe to say that pretty much any shooter you could come up with qualifies for the competition. I hope many entries will take the opportunity to do something interesting with the autofire concept.</description>

      <description>Wow, it&amp;#8217;s been almost a month since I last wrote anything here. I guess blogging is a state of mind, not so much about the importance of the content you write, but about feeling like communicating it to other people. Guess I&amp;#8217;ve been a bit asocial lately. 🙂
You can read Ernest Adams&amp;#8217; wonderful article here. He talks about the need for culturally respectable games in order to consolidate videogames as a respected medium itself.</description>

      <description>I just came back from Mundos Digitales 2006 in La Coru&amp;ntilde;a, where I gave a lecture on Game Design. It was a blast! Lots of interesting presentations, great people from the animation and computer graphics industry, and a whole load of fun partying at night.
Next week I&amp;#8217;ll be flying to the north of Spain again. The GameLab group at the Universidad de Oviedo has invited me to give a similar lecture.</description>

      <description>Mark Rein&amp;#8217;s dismissal of episodic content as a &amp;ldquo;broken model&amp;rdquo;.
He mentions marketability, user interest, price and other things that have come up in this thread. Can&amp;#8217;t wait for the full writeup. Although I can&amp;#8217;t avoid a certain level of agreement with him, it does seem to me that he&amp;#8217;s talking as if the whole distribution and publishing model is not going to change at all.
 Yes, in the current retail, console manufacturer-controled, extremely competitive market, boxed episodic content can&amp;#8217;t work.</description>

      <title>On the reliabilty of software</title>

      <description>I ran into this paper which addresses the topic of software reliability from a (to me) very surprising point of view. In a nutshell, it defends the notion that our computing model (Turing&amp;#8217;s) ties together software complexity and unreliability, but there are fundamentally different approaches where increased complexity actually increases reliability as well. Integrated circuits and our very own brain use such approaches.
It is true that Alan Turing and Fred Brooks are among the worshipped gods of modern software engineering.</description>

      <description>I only spent one year working at High Voltage Software in Chicago, but I have many fond memories of my time there. One of these was working with Eric Nofsinger, who is featured in this Gamasutra feature.While he may sound fairly corporate in his responses, he&amp;#8217;s as driven and talented as they come. He describes some of the joys and woes of being an independent developer, working with licensed material, and striving to create original IP.</description>

      <description>This is too funny. If you are a fan of Psychonauts, you might want to send Microsoft an email expressing your preferences for backwards compatibility support on the 360, but I suggest you get a bit more creative than a straight cut &amp;amp; paste of Tim Schaeffer&amp;#8217;s text. 🙂
Rumour has it that Criterion&amp;#8217;s Burnout team offered their support to make their XBox game work on the emulator, and ended up releasing a native (and awesome) version instead.</description>

      <description>Programmers and programming teams should strive to use a reasonably well defined and consistent set of coding standards in their projects. These typically include rules for notation (use of case and special characters in identifiers, etc), style (layout of language elements within the source code), and idioms (specific usage of language features).
The benefits of a clear and useful coding standard are twofold: make the code easy to read and understand even in the absence of code inspection tools or previous knowledge, and encourage the creation of code whose performance and functionality are safe, predictable, verifiable and maintainable.</description>

      <description>Over the past few years, I have devoted short chunks of time to reflect on what is my personal ideology. I suppose age is a natural motivator for this sort of process, but there have been other fuels burning that fire. Most notable among them is being accused of ideological relativism; of offering explanations to phenomena rather than solutions to problems; of flagging any subject on which I don&amp;#8217;t have a strong position as being too unfocused to be worthy of an position; of using tolerance as an excuse for avoiding a clear standing on subjects in which I am actually not confident, or more to the point, knowledgeable.</description>

      <description>The MiniMicrosoft blog has been a very popular place for Microsofties to anonymously bring up and discuss the issues that plague their company. For those of us not in the loop, the blog might be just a PR stunt by the company&amp;#8217;s HR department, or maybe it&amp;#8217;s exactly what it says and has somehow managed to avoid being bombed by Microsoft&amp;#8217;s policy-enforcement teams. I don&amp;#8217;t know. But they are pounding their chest a lot on the recent announcements by MS executives regarding certain HR practices.</description>

My condolences to the over 100 guys and gals who are now looking for another job. Special best wishes to ex-democoder fellow and great dude Erik Pojar. It&amp;#8217;s eerie that this news comes a week after Take 2 decided to close their Salt Lake City studio Indie Built, and just a few days after they announced the opening of a new studio in Shangai.</description>

      <description>Inspired by the 48-hour game compo and Jari Komppa&amp;#8217;s excellent And The Sky Is Full Of Stars, I sat down and wrote a little minigame, unimaginatively named SpacePaint. Source code included so you can have a laugh. It served as a nice learning tool for the most basic OpenGL, which I had actually never used before (go figure).
Even though the difficulty is not properly balanced, I&amp;#8217;m quite happy about the way this strange gameplay concept worked out.</description>

      <description>The GameSetWatch people continue to be a great source of interesting reads. This time it&amp;#8217;s about the process of creating the XBox 360.
One excerpt surprised me: &amp;ldquo;Microsoft&amp;#8217;s brass was worried that Sony would trump the Xbox 360 by coming out with more memory in the PlayStation 3. So in the spring of 2005, Microsoft made what would become a fateful decision. It decided to double the amount of memory in the box, from 256 megabytes to 512.</description>

      <description>Apparently, Hollywood is scared to death because they can&amp;#8217;t make crap and get rich like they used to. Lynda Obst points at videogames and other distractions (your guess) as reasons why teenagers are not as interested in visiting the movie theater and digesting their latest piece of shit. Gasp! Could teenagers have suddenly become smarter? Surely not.
The secret that is about to kill the movie industry turns out to be word of mouth.</description>

      <description>What a wonderful, entertaining and intelligent movie! I&amp;#8217;ve never been a fan of Spike Lee, but with The Inside Man he manages to disguise as a &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; cop movie what really is a diatribe about deception, racism and how everyone can be fooled by appearances and preconceptions. The movie has many characters, but with just a few lines of dialogue, they all communicate a lot about their personality, background and motivations.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m not travelling to E3 this time, and I can&amp;#8217;t say that I&amp;#8217;m terribly sad about that. I mean, it&amp;#8217;s always cool to get some hands-on experience with new stuff, and see old friends sweating behind closed doors in the epic fight against sensory overload. But the media coverage for E3 has grown so comprehensive, that I would expect to come back and the people here had seen things I hadn&amp;#8217;t even heard of on the showfloor.</description>

      <description>So I sat down and spent a few more hours with the Oblivion on the 360, trying to enjoy it. And I&amp;#8217;m almost there! Almost&amp;#8230; but not quite! I realized that I was reliving the Everquest 2 experience (and Black &amp;amp; White before): a game that is interesting and has many things to do, but I end up not having fun doing them. A game where I like some bits of the graphics but never stop feeling like it&amp;#8217;s all just cardboard cutouts.</description>

Halo 2 is a fantastic game. I only played it halfway through when it first came out, so I took the opportunity to replay it to the end. The story ended up confusing me with the twists and jumps, but the very fact that I was paying attention says a lot about how well presented it was.</description>

      <description>&amp;#8211; Tomb Raider: Legend demo: Surprisingly good! I&amp;#8217;ll play the full game after Easter, although I doubt I&amp;#8217;ll finish it. I enjoyed the first Tomb Raider a lot but eventually grew bored with the puzzles, and never really played the rest. After the series went downhill, this one goes back to the roots. It seems to have more combat and physics-based puzzles, and might very well prove to be the best Tomb Raider.</description>

      <description>Noticed today in Gamasutra that there&amp;#8217;s a Postmortem for Galactic Civilizations 2. The article is very interesting and the team should be proud of their accomplishments. They mention how the first game sold quite well but they failed to receive a good chunk of their royalties due to publisher Strategy First going bankrupt.
Then, in the news section of the same site, I see that Strategy First just acquired small studio Malfador Machinations.</description>

      <description>All I can say is: yay!
Who wants to pay more in order to own a movie they probably already own on DVD, with lesser quality, in a format that can only be played on a specific piece of equipment, and which can&amp;#8217;t even be connected to a TV. At GDC I asked the Sony reps if they planned on releasing the devices they used at the booth to display PSP games on TVs, and they said those were test kits and that such a device was not in the works.</description>

      <description>Nintendo is counting on their new controller and low prices for both hardware and software, as the key factors for their next offering, the Revolution console.
As a goal it is laudable, but the part I don&amp;#8217;t get is&amp;#8230; doesn&amp;#8217;t this consumer already have exactly that in the form of a PS2 or XBox? Both have a pretty extensive collection of fantastic games at budget prices. That&amp;#8217;s the kind of user that Sony counts on to keep the PS2 alive the next 5 or so years.</description>

      <description>Blizzard has one of the best track records in gaming history, with every game release becoming a massive hit. But they have had their share of failures as well: Warcraft Adventures was canned after a year or two, and Warcraft 3 was redesigned from the ground up two years after development started. Now, you may have heard that Blizzard has haltedthe development of Starcraft: Ghost.
So is Starcraft: Ghost going the way of Adventures, or will they pull off a redesign?</description>

      <description>Ah, GDC trip prevented me from uploading the slides from my lecture at the Universidad Polit&amp;eacute;cnica de Catalu&amp;ntilde;a on March 16th 2006. Here you go! Edit: Updated with the latest version of the slides.
They are in Spanish, and if you have read other slides from previous lectures, most of the material will ring a bell. Call me lazy, but there&amp;#8217;s a reason for that: lectures aimed at general audiences (any student at the University) can&amp;#8217;t dive too much on the details of technical issues or they will necessarily alienate parts of the audience who don&amp;#8217;t have the necessary background.</description>

      <description>Cool as ever, with lots of interesting insights and a few disappointments. My one-liner summary: &amp;ldquo;How we stopped worrying and loved to Prototype&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;#8217;ll post some notes and impressions on various lectures later this week. You can hop over to the GDC Archives or Gamasutra for slides and writeups on several conferences.

      <description>Ok, so maybe not a full-fledged Making of feature, but a very interesting interview with the creators of two of the most beautiful and unique games of the past 5 years: ICO and Shadow of the Colossus. Focus is mostly on visual technology, but there&amp;#8217;s a little bit for everyone. Both the game and the article are a must for anyone interested in game development.</description>

I hope Maxis has authorized its release, and they don&amp;#8217;t send a black van to my house. In this day and age where google search gets sued for copyright infringement, you never know. 🙂</description>

      <description>Or have you become an obsolete programmer? Fear not, IBM is working hard to ensure that your skillset remains viable.
Jokes aside, it&amp;#8217;s a very interesting paper that highlights the Cell&amp;#8217;s architecture from the point of view of code generation, which means it&amp;#8217;s probably the most practical article on Cell programming that you&amp;#8217;re going to find in the near term. Yes, for a long time we have been able to ignore the requirements and techniques involved in multiprocessor programming, but that time is over.</description>

      <description>Shameless plug coming up: Ilion Studios, a feature film animation studio, which is sort of a sister company to Pyro Studios. You can watch some frames of the CG film they are working on. I have seen some of the in-progress work they have done, and I can attest that the quality of the modelling and animation is astounding.
Best of lucks friends!</description>

      <description>I just watched Munich from Steven Spielberg. Now, I have been sorely disappointed by every single movie from Spielberg since, I don&amp;#8217;t know, the first Indiana Jones? All of them contain a few touches of brilliance among too much fluff, too many scenes that are either uninteresting (A.I.), pretentious (Schindler&amp;#8217;s List) or plainly mediocre (The War Of The Worlds). In most other movies I don&amp;#8217;t care too much and just enjoy what good is there to enjoy, but with the talent for storytelling and production that Spielberg posesses, the contrast is just too sharp.</description>

      <description>Yeah, hum&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m not calling it the XBox 2 anymore, and I even bought one a couple weeks after release. 🙂
&amp;#8211; XBox Live Arcade positively rocks. I tried to approach it as a dumb user, and found that the menus are not simple, but they are consistent, so once you get the hang of them, anyone should be comfortable. The ability to download game demos, trailers and such is great, now all it needs is more more more content.</description>

&amp;ldquo;What you&amp;#8217;ve proposed is a kind of quantum encyclopedia, where genuine data both exists and doesn&amp;#8217;t exist depending on the precise moment I rely upon your discordant fucking mob for my information.&amp;rdquo;
With the heated debates going on about its updated procedures, policies, goals and fundraising, it&amp;#8217;s hard to see it growing in significance beyond what it currently offers.</description>

      <description>Version 0.2 of the little C# game can be downloaded here. It has a little bit of AI, enough to make the game, if not truly challenging, at least much more interesting.
I have also included a Release version which shouldn&amp;#8217;t require Visual Studio 2005 installed, and links to the necessary runtimes. I get reports that it still fails to run in some machines &amp;#8211; I have no idea why. Can someone help with this?</description>

      <description>Every now and then, I experiment with C# and the .NET Framework. For the most part, it&amp;#8217;s an amazingly useful environment to develop on; you can crank up tools and interfaces in no time, and Visual Studio provides lots of helpers to improve productivity and general comfort. However, not all is rosy. Being a const-correctness fan, I dismayed when I found out about this.

      <description>The December DirectX 9 SDK has been released. It apparently includes some DX10 tech previews requiring unreleased hardware and the latest beta of Windows Vista.
Ah, the joys of another version of the D3DX DLL&amp;#8230;
Edit: Oh yes another buggy installer from your favourite Software giant! A few seconds into the installation, it halted with an error because it couldn&amp;#8217;t find some &amp;ldquo;April 2005 SDK files&amp;rdquo;. Then it started to rollback the installer, and then decided to continue installing anyway.</description>

      <description>The recent revelations about &amp;ldquo;The Warden&amp;rdquo; (Blizzard&amp;#8217;s anti-hack detection system for World of Warcraft) and Sony&amp;#8217;s absurd DRM software (and its EULA), are making headlines everywhere. Are users being robbed of their (our) fundamental rights, or are companies simply exerting theirs? Is law really covering the topics, or are lawyers and companies merely abusing the system to build up power?
This article is very interesting. If you ever felt that Intellectual Property is being interpreted by law and the courts in ways that harm your fundamental rights, but you could never really explain why in reasonably formal terms, you&amp;#8217;ll find plenty of arguments there.</description>

      <description>This movie is really disturbing, and many people (myself included) have been caught off-guard by it. It was brought to my attention again because the director is in charge of the film adaptation for Castlevania.
I love horror movies even though I tend to be very critical of them. However, this is now. When I was a kid, I spent 6 months on light medication after being scared to death by trailers for several movies like Alien, Phantasm and The Fog, which were released about the same time.</description>

      <description>Every now and then, a small independent movie filmed on a shoestring budget, manages to catch some attention. Primer reportedly cost $7000, and it shows: actors being also technicians, blurry focus, bad sound, you name it. But all that doesn&amp;#8217;t matter, the movie tells an incredibly interesting story and has the perfect atmosphere. Guess what, it&amp;#8217;s about a group of people who&amp;#8230; do something great on a shoestring budget.
The sci-fi topics it deals with can be very hard to follow and understand at times, but don&amp;#8217;t worry too much about precise and detailed explanations, just enjoy its twists and turns.</description>

      <description>Think about some of the issues they run into. Sure, Windows is bloated, the Win32 API is full of badly-formed interfaces, but&amp;#8230; there&amp;#8217;s also a lot of crap programmers around using it and preventing the Windows development team from cleaning up the system properly. So, what would YOU do?
&amp;#8211; Let old &amp;amp; misbehaving programs crash? Many people wouldn&amp;#8217;t upgrade to Vista.
&amp;#8211; Leave the old stuff there? Well, this works once or twice, but after 10 years of Windows, the shit tends to accumulate in large piles.</description>

      <description>Found this nifty article in Slashdot, it&amp;#8217;s a very entertaining read. Don&amp;#8217;t take it as the Holy Gospel, it is half information and half provocation, but if you let it make you think about the topic, you may be surprised how many things ring a bell in your head.</description>

      <description>It doesn&amp;#8217;t work on my desktop machine, nor on two other PCs I have tried. Shortly after plugging the USB cable, the iPod goes back to the regular menu like it was disconnected. Sometimes it stays connected, but the moment I try to transfer anything (even just updating a tag on a song from iTunes, or checking the drive from Explorer), it resets to the menu. However, it does work fine on my machine at work and on my laptop.</description>

      <title>Kojima, Colossus, Serenity</title>

      <description>This may be interesting&amp;#8230;
I started playing Shadow of the Colossus&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s simply amazing, a game like no other. The scale of the Colossi and the way you climb up on them makes most other 3rd person games feel as primitive and flat as, say, classic 2D scrollers. It&amp;#8217;s quite hardcore, and breaks pretty much every rule of game design.
Serenity is a plain old fun sci-fi adventures movie. Everything in it is fairly simple and predictable, but the result is very entertaining, and deserved much better success at the box office.</description>

      <description>Ok, so I have a few blogs linked in my page. Over the past week, the first two of them have left their jobs, and precisely in that order. What does that say about me, or them, or anything? 🙂 Are Joel Spolsky and Raymond Chen next in line? Hm&amp;#8230; nah I don&amp;#8217;t think so.
Anyway, if you need some game consultancy work done, I&amp;#8217;m sure you can&amp;#8217;t go wrong with Jamie Fristrom.</description>

      <description>So Ubi Soft has released a short PC demo of the King Kong game&amp;#8230; 2 months in advance??? Granted the demo doesn&amp;#8217;t exactly spoil anything, but with probably the biggest movie license this year, do they really need to get the hype up so early? Aren&amp;#8217;t they running the risk of making the game &amp;ldquo;old news&amp;rdquo; by christmas?
Anyway, the demo is short, but interesting to watch. Textures are a tad bit too sharp, to the point of becoming noisy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to Lord of War, the latest movie from Andrew Niccol. His previous films include everything in Gattaca, writing The Truman Show, and the misguided S1m0ne. Reviews are coming out quite positive, but I don&amp;#8217;t really know why I already had really strong positive vibes about the movie just from the main logo and the 10-word concept.
Of course we&amp;#8217;ll have to wait three months to watch it in Spain.</description>

      <description>Looks like Neil Young of EA gave a very interesting talk at the Tokyo Game Show. In particular, the way he summarizes EA&amp;#8217;s product strategy as &amp;ldquo;high-quality execution, 1-3 design innovations and audience appeal [being] the ideal combination to produce both a critical and commercial hit.&amp;rdquo;
Lots of comments all over the place about the Nintendo Revolution controller. It feels like the Big N is going all-or-nothing: either it redefines gaming and Nintendo becomes the top dog again, or it is seen as a short-lived gimmick and Nintendo is definitely relegated to the niche gamer audience.</description>

      <description>Mini-Microsoft is an interesting and fairly critical blog about life at Microsoft. Lots of insight at the bureaucracies and internal politics that take place at Redmond. Many people consider Microsoft to be well on its downhill path to death. Not like it&amp;#8217;s going to happen next year, but life teaches us that nothing lasts forever; why would nations and companies be any different?
Microsoft still puts out a number of solid products, but most of them have outgrown their level of usefulness &amp;#8211; new releases consisting of features nobody really needs, and the odd improvement (read: bugfix) here and there.</description>

http://www.petefreitag.com/item/455.cfm
I mentioned my feel that the Escapist was a bit elitist&amp;#8230; well it&amp;#8217;s annoyed me that in the latest issue, two articles bash Doom 3 and World of Warcraft, essentially labeling them &amp;ldquo;bad games&amp;rdquo;. I usually wouldn&amp;#8217;t care, but since those are among the best games I&amp;#8217;ve played in the past few years, I had to position myself: it is perfectly OK to personally be uninterested in them, but attempting to imply that they are objectively bad games only shows how little care has been put into creating that opinion.</description>

&amp;#8211; Student projects: should they figure out and design their own game?
&amp;#8211; Assignments: should we require assignments to be completed in order to complete the degree? Should we hand out assignments that can be integrated in the student projects?</description>

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s a new online gaming mag! The Escapist wants to do serious gaming journalism with a polished presentation. There&amp;#8217;s something a bit elitist about it (not unlike UK&amp;#8217;s printed Edge Magazine), but the effort is commendable and the reading well worth your time. Best of lucks!
Reading the piece about Bungie&amp;#8217;s Marathon, I can&amp;#8217;t help but remember my impression of that game back in 1995: an ugly doom clone. Apparently, I missed a LOT of great stuff!</description>

Interesting fact: Over 50,000 people have [my personal] phone number, and in the 2+ years that I&amp;#8217;ve been giving it out (since ATITD 1 went live), I&amp;#8217;ve only had 19 inappropriate phone calls.

      <description>Obligatory comment about The Island: brainless script with very good action and production. Entertainment business in its purest form&amp;#8230; except it seems to be a commercial flop. Was marketing badly done? Were people not interested in the theme of the movie? Was it too sci-fi for the mainstream crowd, while too mainstream for the sci-fi crowd?
Whatever the reasons, expect Michael Bay to go back to absurdly bad movies like Con-Air or Pearl Harbor.</description>

      <description>Slashdot spotted this from good old Joel on Software
One word of caution: the article seems like an appeal for the prima-donnas in the software industry. Anyone with a few years of experience has endured the pains of diva team members screwing the mood, atmosphere, and ultimately the project. Talent and dedication are the most important traits in a programmer; knowledge can be acquired, experience is just a matter of time, but talent is innate, and dedication is a part of the personality.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve also changed the buttons (who were basically ripped Asheron&amp;#8217;s Call 2 bitmaps) and changed reply listing to go the more familiar older-to-newer.

      <description>As expected, after our more than successful first attempt at the 40-man Molten Core dungeon, a number of people have left the guild, in search of a more dedicated (and numerous) group of players who can guarantee such 40-man, 3-4 hour raids several days a week. Good luck, and good riddance! They are mostly nice people but they are impatient; can&amp;#8217;t blame them, however I would have liked to see more of them being upfront about the whole thing: THEY want the big stuff NOW, so there was no need to blame everyone else for &amp;ldquo;not being there&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Well, turned out that the road to 60 wasn&amp;#8217;t that hard, but could be terribly annoying. A couple of days when I tried to quest solo in my 50&amp;#8217;s I ended up logging out completely angry at the groups of Alliances enjoying a cheap shot. However, the group instances (Uldaman, Zul&amp;#8217;Farrak, Maraudon and Sunken Temple) allowed me to play with other people in a gank-free environment.
So at 60 now, free to run any high-level instances with the friends, the shadow of repetition and eventual boredom looms in the horizon, but until that happens, it is more fun than ever.</description>

      <description>Well, this story (book and 50&amp;#8217;s movie) has been in my mind since I was a kid, a reference for all other stories about aliens taking over Earth. I was hopeful that Spielberg&amp;#8217;s version would be the great alien invasion movie, some kind of grandiose version of the book&amp;#8217;s idea.
Instead, we got a pretty standard movie, with kids, dysfunctional family, some watered-down horror and some simplistic action. Not bad, but I didn&amp;#8217;t feel immersed at any point throughout the movie.</description>

      <description>Yesterday was the conclusion of the 1st Master in Game Programming at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. It&amp;#8217;s been great! The students had to step up and show their projects in front of a crowd, got their diplomas, and we all had fun celebrating it. They should be really proud of their accomplishment, the projects were quite ambitious but they were able to wrap up quite reasonable versions. Lots of variety, from strategy to racing, 2D and 3D, humour-based and seriuos ideas, singleplayer and networked, there was a bit of everything.</description>

      <description>Heh, I&amp;#8217;ve reached a strange point in my WoW life. Up until now I had been leveling up slowly, taking my time, joking in the guild chat, devoting time to explore the world and the places I&amp;#8217;m not supposed to be at.
Thanks to the wonderful dynamics of a PvP server, all that is changing. After level 40 or so, solo questing and hunting has become a real chore, with zones full of red-named players that want to see you die, no matter the means or the (lack of) reward.</description>

      <description>Interesting topic of discussion here. Summary: well-known internet ad firm says systems that block their ads will remove opportunities for sites that want to remain free (their claim is a lot more outrageous, but of course they&amp;#8217;re an ad firm so what do you expect?).
Like I mentioned a couple posts below regarding MSN Messenger, the real problem comes when you annoy people. Like most people remark in the slashdot discussion, I never have had a problem with Google Ads, and I have clicked them a few times.</description>

Edit: finally revamped the Gallery to use a database backend and an upload form through the web. Took a while to figure out all the proper parameters and code in the PHP script and the server panel, but it works now.</description>

      <description>Maybe someone can shed light on this. This morning I found 300 emails in my inbox, from various Mailer Systems, notifying that &amp;ldquo;my email could not be delivered&amp;rdquo;, all from various sources and different styles. Some of them included the original email or the subject, which was essentially spam.
My PCs were turned off at the time all those error emails were generated and sent, so I doubt I have been virused or trojaned.</description>

      <description>Microsoft finally launches a casual game download service for the XBox. Strane, considering the next iteration of the console comes out in about 6 months, and the service is launched in Europe of all places. I assume they simply want to test and polish the download / promotion / billing system so it&amp;#8217;s available out of the box for XBox 360&amp;#8217;s launch.
Oh and Jason is right: I have given up and joined the masses in accepting the XBox 360&amp;#8217;s name.</description>

And, of course, nothing beats a few sunny days in the Basque Country. Good times.</description>

      <description>Interesting quote from Greg Costikyan: &amp;ldquo;fostering an independent games movement really requires solving three problems simultaneously: First, creating a desire among developers to do something different; second, finding a solution to the business issue of creating a viable channel for distribution of independent product; and third, changing gamer culture. By that I mean that people who like indie music and film are willing to accept lower production values in exchange for individual vision and creativity.</description>

      <description>Browsing through GI.biz, I came across this bit where a UK store is speculating with a retail price of 400 pounds for the XBox 360. That got me thinking into the prices for other territories.
400 UK pounds is roughly US$ 700. However history says a more likely US price would be $500. History also says that the rest of Europe would see a price of 500 Euros. Weighing in the standards of living, average salaries and whatnot, this means gaming in Spain and most of Europe is twice as expensive as gaming in the US.</description>

      <description>Nightwish, Slayer, Marilyn Manson along with a few others. Slayer were capable but boring (I just don&amp;#8217;t like machinegun metal); Marilyn Manson was effective but a bit uninspired; Nightwish totally rocked the place, with great performance and what I believe to be the best sound I&amp;#8217;ve experienced in a live concert since Mike Oldfield.</description>

      <description>Will Wright chatted with Wired, and participated in an E3 panel. Great stuff in both articles.
I went to watch Star Wars: Episode III &amp;#8211; Revenge of the Sith, and was pleasantly surprised! While the two prequels had been visually amazing, the story, dialogue and character development seriously lacked. Episode 3 &amp;#8211; RotS is different: the story is really good, and it certainly has the darker tone that Lucas had promised.</description>

      <description>The first battle, in what will hopefully be a long war, is over. Both have given their first presentation, and Sony has completely stolen the show. Why? Because they have shown a lot of cool stuff and Microsoft hasn&amp;#8217;t, that&amp;#8217;s why. At the moment theres a certain feeling that Sony has Dreamcasted the XBox 2 (I refuse to call it 360).
Most of the videos are pre-rendered clips, and for those that are in-game footage, when you see the screenshots you notice a lot of tricks which you know will lessen the sense of photorealism and detail.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m not terribly happy with the way the lecture went. To begin with, there were very few attendants; Friday afternoon right before a long weekend with sunny weather? Even I was anxious to hit the road and get to the beach! I also felt that the students were more curious that truly interested in professional and philosophical games development issues.</description>

      <description>Their current argument over the encryption system in Nikon&amp;#8217;s Raw file format is pretty funny. In the past, Adobe has been just as protective about their own format: Adobe&amp;#8217;s font formats were not open, and the Photoshop SDK stopped being freely available around version 7. So, I am the happy owner of two Nikon digital cameras, I dislike unnecessary protection / encryption systems, Photoshop is an amazing piece of software, and my experiences with Adobe&amp;#8217;s tech support people have been horribly bad.</description>

It was bound to happen, sooner or later, but it is still shocking to see it materialized. I have never been interested in buying online properties, since I assume that acquiring them in the game is one of the main reasons for playing in the first place. Playing a MMO has to be fun in itself, but as we know already, fun is a dish with many ingredients.
So, rather than find my own stance among all the moral, ethical, emotional, rational debates about the meaning of this, I&amp;#8217;ll be realistic about my assumptions, and simply sit back and see what happens.</description>

One of the reasons is Devil May Cry 3 on the Playstation 2. The concept: you are a human-demon slashing and gunning hordes of demons in a quest to prevent the Demon World from taking over Earth, while uncovering the secrets of your family as you progress.</description>

      <description>After reading a number of SF novels from the last few years, I keep getting frustrated at what feels like a failed renaissance of the genre. I enjoy the emphasis on real world politics, innovative science and weird but believable theories, now that time travel, hyperspace and robots are pretty much exhausted. Many books seem too much &amp;ldquo;Crichtonized&amp;rdquo; &amp;#8211; trying to match the formula that blends larger-than-life characters involved in a limited version of world-changing events.</description>

      <description>Yes, it arrived in Europe, and went on to surpass all expectations. I&amp;#8217;m finally playing it without the &amp;ldquo;beta hat&amp;rdquo;, so I can put some effort into the chars I play.
It is every bit as awesome as it felt in the beta. Penny-Arcade wrote this about Burnout 3, but I think it describes WoW perfectly:
&amp;ldquo;Try to imagine a scenario in which someone paid you twenty dollars every time you had an orgasm.</description>

      <description>Million Dollar Baby is the latest movie by Clint Eastwood. If you follow my musings about films, you may know I totally love his work. Well, I think this movie is a complete and flawless masterpiece. Script, dialogues, characters, pacing, everything about it totally blew me away. There&amp;#8217;s little more to say, really.</description>

      <description>3D Blasphemy posted some stills and a video of a photorealistic city render he did to experiment with postproduction effects and lighting. It&amp;#8217;s really impressive, I recommend you check it out!

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s a pretty cool 2-part interview:
http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=6281
Despite the pseudo-standard language they use, their description of what makes World of Warcraft so engaging matches every bit of what I felt while playing the beta.
In other news, I finished watching the second season of Alias, and it was very entertaining! Lost of surprises, great pace, and an extremely ambitious cliffhanger. Also entertaining was Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. The action scenes were not very exciting, which detracted from the movie, but the unique style still makes it well worth watching.</description>

      <description>I just watched Irreversible, a truly unique, graphic and brutal french film about (so to speak) violence against women. Only for people with either a strong stomach, or a complete lack thereof, especially if you&amp;#8217;re a woman. Despite the &amp;ldquo;shock value&amp;rdquo; that one may read in the film, it has so much more.
Also watched Alexander which, while overly long and pretentious (european production kicks in), was still worth it.</description>

      <description>Well it&amp;#8217;s finally happening! I&amp;#8217;m taking a 6-month sabbatical away from Pyro Studios and work, to replenish my batteries and pursue some things I&amp;#8217;ve been NOT doing for too long. Game development is tough and stressing, and after this many years I feel the drain, so when the opportunity showed up I decided to take it.
Some people are betting after I have relaxed for a few weeks I won&amp;#8217;t feel up to the task of going &amp;ldquo;back to the trenches&amp;rdquo;&amp;#8230; All I can say is, I still feel the same passion for games development, so despite the hardships and headaches, expect me back in the summer.</description>

      <description>A Spanish website reprinted a Wired Magazine interview with Hiroshi Yamauchi, retired CEO of Nintendo. It was all a hoax for the Dec 28th, which is Spain&amp;#8217;s version of April Fools.

It&amp;#8217;s awesome, outrageous, fun and&amp;#8230; yeah I had to be told it was a fake.

      <description>Amazing movie, Pixar once again outdoing themselves. Everything in the movie is a joy to see: characters, style, animation, special effects, script, action&amp;#8230; It&amp;#8217;s just too good to describe it in depth here.
Also watched Alien vs. Predator, which was ok, entertaining and forgettable action. Shaun of the Dead was quite funny, too cheap and sitcom-like to be a classic, but an above-average parody.
A few months ago I bought Blood Simple on DVD, but didn&amp;#8217;t get around to watching it until yesterday.</description>

      <description>To sum it up, I&amp;#8217;m disappointed after 5-6 hours with it. It&amp;#8217;s great to see and play with all the amazing technology tricks shown in the HL2 promo videos; visuals and atmosphere is sometimes brilliant; the gravity gun is a very original and interesting idea. But! In my experience, it just lacks pace and coherence. It starts great, then drives you nuts with an overly long driving sequence, then the whole thing goes to hell when you are thrown into a messy pit of physics puzzles with zombies and a mad guy jumping around.</description>

      <description>After the Half-Life 2 experience (not finished yet), I&amp;#8217;m in love with FPS games again! Halo 2 is probably the most fluid and downright fun shooter I have ever played. Not terribly innovative, but does everything right, and brings an outstanding dual-wielding feature that will most surely become as standard as the WASD keyboard layout. And I thought it was just eye-candy for the masses when I saw that in the videos&amp;#8230; Well written script without imposing overly long narrative sections, a perfect design where different gameplay styles blend smoothly, nice array of weapons and enemies, and again a control and aiming implementation that makes the keyboard and mouse almost obsolete.</description>

And the current IGDA and slashdot discussion threads on the issue:

Reading the article may be depressing (just like 1999&amp;#8217;s Why Being a Computer Game Developer Sucks did), but it also serves as a reminder, for those of us that want to spend the rest of our professional lives making games, that we need to improve our management practices and truly care for the people we work with.</description>

      <description>Finally started playing the stress test / open beta. My first impression is that it&amp;#8217;s a polished and pretty DAoC set in the Warcraft universe. If I actually have the patience to progress my char and see the high-level game, I&amp;#8217;ll have more things to say, .</description>

I watched the movie Spartan again, and I loved every bit of it again.
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas smashed every record for sales during the first weekend, and easily competes with any major blockbuster movie. Crisis? What crisis? Well&amp;#8230; Longtime developer Argonaut (of Starglider fame) went bankrupt, which is not good news.</description>

      <description>Fileplanet download
Basically, it fixes the bug with troops becoming invulnerable after splitting them. It includes the 1.04 fixes as well, so you can apply it directly to a fresh install of the game (any language, including eastern versions). It is not officially supported, but I&amp;#8217;m very confident that it works.
My big thanks to all the people who helped with this, and those who had the patience to wait this long.</description>

      <description>And I still own that 3-year old piece of crap PC. I hope the game really is so good that I finally find an excuse to upgrade.
It will be interesting to see how the whole deal with Steam sales vs. retail goes&amp;#8230; especially with the &amp;ldquo;preload&amp;rdquo; trick that Valve pulled off: removing the pains of having to wait for the download while other people are already playing, means that more people will be willing to go the Steam route.</description>

      <description>Now for something completely different. Since a few days ago, some people have decided to use our parking spots at the office. Different people each time, this wednesday it was a police car that invaded our space! (Our offices are located near a police station)
Today there were two cars, so after the usual process of asking around with no results, I simply moved my car to block the exit of our area of the garage, and left a note to come upstairs if someone needed to exit.</description>
