                        The MiniMicrosoft blog has been a very popular place for Microsofties to anonymously bring up and discuss the issues that plague their company. For those of us not in the loop, the blog might be just a PR stunt by the company&#8217;s HR department, or maybe it&#8217;s exactly what it says and has somehow managed to avoid being bombed by Microsoft&#8217;s policy-enforcement teams. I don&#8217;t know. But they are pounding their chest a lot on the recent announcements by MS executives regarding certain HR practices.

                        While all our attention was focused on the bells and whistles of E3, bad things were happening back in Viena. My condolences to the over 100 guys and gals who are now looking for another job. Special best wishes to ex-democoder fellow and great dude Erik Pojar. It&#8217;s eerie that this news comes a week after Take 2 decided to close their Salt Lake City studio Indie Built, and just a few days after they announced the opening of a new studio in Shangai.

                        Inspired by the 48-hour game compo and Jari Komppa&#8217;s excellent And The Sky Is Full Of Stars, I sat down and wrote a little minigame, unimaginatively named SpacePaint. Source code included so you can have a laugh. It served as a nice learning tool for the most basic OpenGL, which I had actually never used before (go figure). Even though the difficulty is not properly balanced, I&#8217;m quite happy about the way this strange gameplay concept worked out.

                        The GameSetWatch people continue to be a great source of interesting reads. This time it&#8217;s about the process of creating the XBox 360. One excerpt surprised me: &ldquo;Microsoft&#8217;s brass was worried that Sony would trump the Xbox 360 by coming out with more memory in the PlayStation 3. So in the spring of 2005, Microsoft made what would become a fateful decision. It decided to double the amount of memory in the box, from 256 megabytes to 512.&rdquo; Having been one of the many developers who believed that 256 megs of RAM was going to be a disaster of epic proportions (and I wrote as much in my feedback report), I can&#8217;t help but disagree with the term &ldquo;fateful&rdquo;.

                        Apparently, Hollywood is scared to death because they can&#8217;t make crap and get rich like they used to. Lynda Obst points at videogames and other distractions (your guess) as reasons why teenagers are not as interested in visiting the movie theater and digesting their latest piece of shit. Gasp! Could teenagers have suddenly become smarter? Surely not. The secret that is about to kill the movie industry turns out to be word of mouth.

                        What a wonderful, entertaining and intelligent movie! I&#8217;ve never been a fan of Spike Lee, but with The Inside Man he manages to disguise as a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; cop movie what really is a diatribe about deception, racism and how everyone can be fooled by appearances and preconceptions. The movie has many characters, but with just a few lines of dialogue, they all communicate a lot about their personality, background and motivations.

I&#8217;m not travelling to E3 this time, and I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m terribly sad about that. I mean, it&#8217;s always cool to get some hands-on experience with new stuff, and see old friends sweating behind closed doors in the epic fight against sensory overload. But the media coverage for E3 has grown so comprehensive, that I would expect to come back and the people here had seen things I hadn&#8217;t even heard of on the showfloor.

                        So I sat down and spent a few more hours with the Oblivion on the 360, trying to enjoy it. And I&#8217;m almost there! Almost&#8230; but not quite! I realized that I was reliving the Everquest 2 experience (and Black &amp; White before): a game that is interesting and has many things to do, but I end up not having fun doing them. A game where I like some bits of the graphics but never stop feeling like it&#8217;s all just cardboard cutouts.

                        Little Mathematics has recently interviewedKenta Cho. He knows how to make beautiful, engaging and unique games, he releases them for free including source code, and he does it all out of sheer love for the classic shooting genre. And of course, he loves Geometry Wars on the 360. ðŸ™‚
