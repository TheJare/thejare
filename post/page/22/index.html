                        Greg talks indie games&#8230; again! My biggest problem with this type of manifestos is, they all end with the motto &ldquo;let&#8217;s make better games&rdquo;, they rarely address the question &ldquo;better for who?&rdquo; I&#8217;m an Old Turk (almost 19 years since my first game went gold), but my list of favourite games include GTA, Call of Duty, Age of Mythology, Halo, World of Warcraft&#8230; all vey high budget games, and all considered derivative in some form.

                        My guildmates in WoW asked me to design a points system to manage the high-end raid loot drops. I&#8217;m not sure if they&#8217;re going to use it, but since I&#8217;d hate to waste the effort, here&#8217;s the link. I&#8217;ve also changed the buttons (who were basically ripped Asheron&#8217;s Call 2 bitmaps) and changed reply listing to go the more familiar older-to-newer. Ok this is too funny to miss: WW2 RTS

                        As expected, after our more than successful first attempt at the 40-man Molten Core dungeon, a number of people have left the guild, in search of a more dedicated (and numerous) group of players who can guarantee such 40-man, 3-4 hour raids several days a week. Good luck, and good riddance! They are mostly nice people but they are impatient; can&#8217;t blame them, however I would have liked to see more of them being upfront about the whole thing: THEY want the big stuff NOW, so there was no need to blame everyone else for &ldquo;not being there&rdquo;.

                        Well, turned out that the road to 60 wasn&#8217;t that hard, but could be terribly annoying. A couple of days when I tried to quest solo in my 50&#8217;s I ended up logging out completely angry at the groups of Alliances enjoying a cheap shot. However, the group instances (Uldaman, Zul&#8217;Farrak, Maraudon and Sunken Temple) allowed me to play with other people in a gank-free environment. So at 60 now, free to run any high-level instances with the friends, the shadow of repetition and eventual boredom looms in the horizon, but until that happens, it is more fun than ever.

                        Well, this story (book and 50&#8217;s movie) has been in my mind since I was a kid, a reference for all other stories about aliens taking over Earth. I was hopeful that Spielberg&#8217;s version would be the great alien invasion movie, some kind of grandiose version of the book&#8217;s idea. Instead, we got a pretty standard movie, with kids, dysfunctional family, some watered-down horror and some simplistic action. Not bad, but I didn&#8217;t feel immersed at any point throughout the movie.

                        Yesterday was the conclusion of the 1st Master in Game Programming at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. It&#8217;s been great! The students had to step up and show their projects in front of a crowd, got their diplomas, and we all had fun celebrating it. They should be really proud of their accomplishment, the projects were quite ambitious but they were able to wrap up quite reasonable versions. Lots of variety, from strategy to racing, 2D and 3D, humour-based and seriuos ideas, singleplayer and networked, there was a bit of everything.

                        Heh, I&#8217;ve reached a strange point in my WoW life. Up until now I had been leveling up slowly, taking my time, joking in the guild chat, devoting time to explore the world and the places I&#8217;m not supposed to be at. Thanks to the wonderful dynamics of a PvP server, all that is changing. After level 40 or so, solo questing and hunting has become a real chore, with zones full of red-named players that want to see you die, no matter the means or the (lack of) reward.

                        Interesting topic of discussion here. Summary: well-known internet ad firm says systems that block their ads will remove opportunities for sites that want to remain free (their claim is a lot more outrageous, but of course they&#8217;re an ad firm so what do you expect?). Like I mentioned a couple posts below regarding MSN Messenger, the real problem comes when you annoy people. Like most people remark in the slashdot discussion, I never have had a problem with Google Ads, and I have clicked them a few times.
