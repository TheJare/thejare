                            Interesting topic of discussion here. Summary: well-known internet ad firm says systems that block their ads will remove opportunities for sites that want to remain free (their claim is a lot more outrageous, but of course they&#8217;re an ad firm so what do you expect?). Like I mentioned a couple posts below regarding MSN Messenger, the real problem comes when you annoy people. Like most people remark in the slashdot discussion, I never have had a problem with Google Ads, and I have clicked them a few times.

                            <p>Added 5 or 6 new pics to the <a href="http://www.iguanademos.com/Jare/Gallery.php">Gallery</a>. Also discovered <a href="http://www.steelbytes.com/?mid=30" target="_blank">a handy tool</a> to remove all the crap that Photoshop insists on including in JPG files. Thumbnail pics gone down from 18Kb to 4Kb, what&#8217;s not to like?</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> finally revamped the Gallery to use a database backend and an upload form through the web. Took a while to figure out all the proper parameters and code in the PHP script and the server panel, but it works now.</p>

                            Maybe someone can shed light on this. This morning I found 300 emails in my inbox, from various Mailer Systems, notifying that &ldquo;my email could not be delivered&rdquo;, all from various sources and different styles. Some of them included the original email or the subject, which was essentially spam. My PCs were turned off at the time all those error emails were generated and sent, so I doubt I have been virused or trojaned.

                            Microsoft finally launches a casual game download service for the XBox. Strane, considering the next iteration of the console comes out in about 6 months, and the service is launched in Europe of all places. I assume they simply want to test and polish the download / promotion / billing system so it&#8217;s available out of the box for XBox 360&#8217;s launch. Oh and Jason is right: I have given up and joined the masses in accepting the XBox 360&#8217;s name.

                            Interesting quote from Greg Costikyan: &ldquo;fostering an independent games movement really requires solving three problems simultaneously: First, creating a desire among developers to do something different; second, finding a solution to the business issue of creating a viable channel for distribution of independent product; and third, changing gamer culture. By that I mean that people who like indie music and film are willing to accept lower production values in exchange for individual vision and creativity.&rdquo; Imagine a world where you pay $15-$25 for games that last 2-3 hours.

                            Browsing through GI.biz, I came across this bit where a UK store is speculating with a retail price of 400 pounds for the XBox 360. That got me thinking into the prices for other territories. 400 UK pounds is roughly US$ 700. However history says a more likely US price would be $500. History also says that the rest of Europe would see a price of 500 Euros. Weighing in the standards of living, average salaries and whatnot, this means gaming in Spain and most of Europe is twice as expensive as gaming in the US.

                            <p><a href="http://www.nightwish.com/" target="_blank">Nightwish</a>, Slayer, Marilyn Manson along with a few others. Slayer were capable but boring (I just don&#8217;t like machinegun metal); Marilyn Manson was effective but a bit uninspired; Nightwish totally rocked the place, with great performance and what I believe to be the best sound I&#8217;ve experienced in a live concert since Mike Oldfield.</p>
