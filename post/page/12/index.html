                            My 2 sisters and my parents never really understood my brotherâ€™s and my own fixation with videgames. They mostly accepted it, understood it was something that we enjoyed, and at some point they were happy that we made successful (even if a bit rollercoaster-like) careers out of it. The closest thing they got to enjoying a videogame was watching me play Ico.
Marta was sometimes curious about some games when she was much younger, but since then she kind of felt that videogames were a terrible way to waste oneâ€™s spare time.

                            So, Scott Miller thinks Valve is not a good route to follow, with quotes like &ldquo;Iâ€™m not a big fan of using Steam, because Iâ€™m not a fan of a strong competitor of ours having access to our download stats and revenue totals.&quot; or &ldquo;if Valve doesnâ€™t do well for a game or two, Steam will get cut before their internal game development&rdquo;. Then, the same day, Prey gets released on Steam.

                            I finally had a few hours to sit down and play the game through to the end. It is verygood, probably the shooter Iâ€™ve enjoyed the most since the original Halo. The technology is brilliant, the levels and firefights are very well designed, and the production is fantastic. Itâ€™s a lot of fun to play, and brings a fresh approach to the genre. It takes a while getting used to the controls, movement and cover-based fighting, but the first Act does a good job of teaching you all of that without being too easy.

                            Some people have emailed me to ask if &ldquo;what they have heard&rdquo; is true. Yes, it is: this Christmas I will be leaving Pyro Studios. Unlike other veterans, Iâ€™m staying in the games industry; I have already accepted a job offer outside of Spain, which means I will be doing a lot of packing in a couple months.
Leaving the company at which I have worked hard for the past eight years was a hard decision, but in hindsight it was inevitable.

                            I just came back from having dinner with Enric Alvarez, the CEO of Mercury Steam and currently hard at work on Clive Barkerâ€™s Jericho. We shared a roundtable a couple weeks ago in Art Futura, but didnâ€™t have much time to talk there. Great food and even better conversation. Although itâ€™s not been easy for such a small studio, they seem to be doing a great job transitioning into the fabled next-gen.

                            I sat down today to check out whatâ€™s inside XNA Games Studio, the platform which Microsoft touts as the future of bedroom games coding (well, sort of). Itâ€™s still in beta 2, and it doesnâ€™t support XBox 360 executables yet, but it works fairly well. I ported my old C# game experiment without much pain, and you can check the results here. Donâ€™t expect a lot of polish in the code or the actual game: the platform is still beta after all, so I didnâ€™t want to spend more than a few hours with it.

                            After waking up somewhat early, I sat down and tried Defcon by &ldquo;the last of the bedroom coders&rdquo; Introversion Software. The gameâ€™s premise and visuals are fascinating: an RTS about global thermonuclear warfare, with a graphical style borrowed from tactical displays (as seen in movies like the inspirational Wargames).
After a simple and clear tutorial, you can start freeform games in a multiplayer-oriented fashion. There are no campaign or missions, but you can make games versus AI.

                            <p>I just watched the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">El Laberinto Del Fauno</a> (Panâ€™s Labyrinth), by fantasy film master Guillermo Del Toro. What a wonderful movie! It is a dramatic and at times gruesome fairytale set in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, with stunning visuals and a gripping story. One of the best films of this year, which sadly wonâ€™t get enough worldwide attention due to it being recorded in spanish.</p>
