                        In the wake of the Slamdance fiasco (6 finalists have already dropped), I&#8217;m ending up checking the entries. I ran into Book &amp; Volume, and thought it might give me new respect for the current state of Interactive Fiction. After 5 minutes, it&#8217;s only given me despair. It works like a classic text adventure: a bunch of text and a prompt where you write what you want to do. So the game starts: I&#8217;m in a room, there&#8217;s a pager buzzing.

                        These past days I&#8217;ve been increasingly interested in the controversy raised by this game, its inclusion and later removal from the roster of finalists of the Slamdance Festival, and the debates the whole thing has created. I won&#8217;t bother linking every piece of the story, as other people have already done so. You can download the game from the Manifesto site, or (given how bad the actual gameplay is) watch a video run of it.

                        Excellent article here. Worthy alone for the differentiation between having goals and pushing the player in certain directions. It should be obvious that &ldquo;giving you something to do&rdquo;, and &ldquo;forcing you to do something&rdquo; do not need to be present together, but I had never thought of that in the context of sandbox and linear games.

                        Whereas the visuals for Hard Candy didn&#8217;t totally do it for me, Children of Men is a whole different thing. A very unforgiving look at how our modern society would destroy itself if the reins were let a bit loose. The movie has some problems with pacing and very unlikely resolutions to some situations, but it still well worth watching. The visual design is amazing and (in my opinion) deserves at least an Oscar for Cinematography.

                        The good news is that Soul Calibur 2 Xbox is among the new batch of gamessupported by the 360 emulator. The bad news is that only the US version does. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I know that my brother and the other Ninjas keep working their asses to make this stuff happen, but sometimes I think I&#8217;m jinxed. I&#8217;ve never been much into fighting games, but the Soul Calibur was uniquely awesome and still my favourite.

                        After all the jabs that Sony threw on Microsoft for being unable to play ALL XBox games in its 360 backcompat emulator, someone decided to check how Sony&#8217;s efforts are much better. This video is the result, and does create serious doubts that anyone will want to play their PS2 games on a PS3. If they work at all, that is, because Sony has a list and even a database of their own.

                        Microsoft&#8217;s XNA Games Studio Express 1.0 has been released, opening the door (for a price) to homebrew XBox 360 development. Will it work, or flop like Sony&#8217;s PS1 Yaroze? $100 a year, lack of networking, and the inability of unsubscribed users to run your games are not homebrew-friendly features.

                        My 2 sisters and my parents never really understood my brother&#8217;s and my own fixation with videgames. They mostly accepted it, understood it was something that we enjoyed, and at some point they were happy that we made successful (even if a bit rollercoaster-like) careers out of it. The closest thing they got to enjoying a videogame was watching me play Ico. Marta was sometimes curious about some games when she was much younger, but since then she kind of felt that videogames were a terrible way to waste one&#8217;s spare time.

                        So, Scott Miller thinks Valve is not a good route to follow, with quotes like &ldquo;Iâ€™m not a big fan of using Steam, because Iâ€™m not a fan of a strong competitor of ours having access to our download stats and revenue totals.&rdquo; or &ldquo;if Valve doesnâ€™t do well for a game or two, Steam will get cut before their internal game development&rdquo;. Then, the same day, Prey gets released on Steam.
