                        Guess I never got down to post my notes&#8230; actually, I haven&#8217;t written most of them yet! Ah well, it&#8217;s not like I promised anyone. ðŸ™‚ Keep checking the Archives page because they have added many new slides. Halo 2 is a fantastic game. I only played it halfway through when it first came out, so I took the opportunity to replay it to the end. The story ended up confusing me with the twists and jumps, but the very fact that I was paying attention says a lot about how well presented it was.

                        &#8211; Tomb Raider: Legend demo: Surprisingly good! I&#8217;ll play the full game after Easter, although I doubt I&#8217;ll finish it. I enjoyed the first Tomb Raider a lot but eventually grew bored with the puzzles, and never really played the rest. After the series went downhill, this one goes back to the roots. It seems to have more combat and physics-based puzzles, and might very well prove to be the best Tomb Raider.

                        Noticed today in Gamasutra that there&#8217;s a Postmortem for Galactic Civilizations 2. The article is very interesting and the team should be proud of their accomplishments. They mention how the first game sold quite well but they failed to receive a good chunk of their royalties due to publisher Strategy First going bankrupt. Then, in the news section of the same site, I see that Strategy First just acquired small studio Malfador Machinations.

                        All I can say is: yay! Who wants to pay more in order to own a movie they probably already own on DVD, with lesser quality, in a format that can only be played on a specific piece of equipment, and which can&#8217;t even be connected to a TV. At GDC I asked the Sony reps if they planned on releasing the devices they used at the booth to display PSP games on TVs, and they said those were test kits and that such a device was not in the works.

                        Nintendo is counting on their new controller and low prices for both hardware and software, as the key factors for their next offering, the Revolution console. As a goal it is laudable, but the part I don&#8217;t get is&#8230; doesn&#8217;t this consumer already have exactly that in the form of a PS2 or XBox? Both have a pretty extensive collection of fantastic games at budget prices. That&#8217;s the kind of user that Sony counts on to keep the PS2 alive the next 5 or so years.

                        Blizzard has one of the best track records in gaming history, with every game release becoming a massive hit. But they have had their share of failures as well: Warcraft Adventures was canned after a year or two, and Warcraft 3 was redesigned from the ground up two years after development started. Now, you may have heard that Blizzard has haltedthe development of Starcraft: Ghost. So is Starcraft: Ghost going the way of Adventures, or will they pull off a redesign?

                        Ah, GDC trip prevented me from uploading the slides from my lecture at the Universidad Polit&eacute;cnica de Catalu&ntilde;a on March 16th 2006. Here you go! Edit: Updated with the latest version of the slides. They are in Spanish, and if you have read other slides from previous lectures, most of the material will ring a bell. Call me lazy, but there&#8217;s a reason for that: lectures aimed at general audiences (any student at the University) can&#8217;t dive too much on the details of technical issues or they will necessarily alienate parts of the audience who don&#8217;t have the necessary background.

                        Ok, so maybe not a full-fledged Making of feature, but a very interesting interview with the creators of two of the most beautiful and unique games of the past 5 years: ICO and Shadow of the Colossus. Focus is mostly on visual technology, but there&#8217;s a little bit for everyone. Both the game and the article are a must for anyone interested in game development.
