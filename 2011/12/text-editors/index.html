                        <p>Programmers spend most of our time in front of a text editor. Whether it is a standalone editor, or one integrated in an IDE, that&#8217;s just what we do.</p>

<p>Back in MS-DOS days, my editor of choice was <a title="QEdit" href="http://www.semware.com/" target="_blank">QEdit</a>, later renamed to The Semware Editor. I loved its configurability, and remapped pretty much everything in it to suit my preferences. Around that time I was also working on Unix systems and used vi there, although only for short editing sessions. I had been exposed to <a title="Emacs" href="http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a> multiple times (starting with MicroEmacs on the Atari ST), but I could never get comfortable with its crazy keyboard combos.</p>

<p>After Windows 95 came and became my regular environment, the best choice was <a title="Ultraedit" href="http://www.ultraedit.com/" target="_blank">Ultraedit</a>. Very soon, Microsoft Visual Studio became the compiler and IDE of choice for Win95 development, and its built-in editor proved quite powerful, so I would use Ultraedit for editing files that were not C++.</p>

<p>The big annoyance with Ultraedit was that, being a paid product, it was not readily available everywhere I could go. At work, at someone else&#8217;s computer, etc. And it seemed to become more bloated with each version. I started looking for alternatives, and settled with <a title="SciTE" href="http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html" target="_blank">SciTE</a>. SciTE is the editor built around the Scintilla text-editing component / library. It&#8217;s a very powerful and extensible text editor, but the default installation is rather barebones and lacks many useful text manipulation tools. I was also bothered by the way it implemented rectangular block selections. So I started looking for alternatives again.</p>

<p>The next editor I used was <a title="Notepad++" href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>, another editor built around Scintilla. Free, lots of features, and lots of free and easy to install plugins. I was completely comfortable with it, no major complaints. Ok well, yeah, one major complaint actually: the &#8220;Find in Files&#8221; dialog box was fixed in size, and the space available for the listbox of folders to search in was rather short. It was annoying to work with long, descriptive paths. I changed the dialog size and recompiled the editor, but it sucked to do that for every new version of the editor. The other issue with Notepad++ was that I was using Linux (Ubuntu) both at work and on my netbook, and Notepad++ is 100% Windows-only. Oh, and some of the settings are really awkward to configure. Yeah, a great editor, but a number of annoyances.</p>

<p>In text-mode terminals on Ubuntu I had been using joe for quick edits, but for any significant amount of work I slowly started using (and getting used to) <a title="vim" href="http://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">vim</a> again. Since I was restless with Notepad++, I tried getting used to gvim on Windows, but despite its <a href="http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html" target="_blank">many good points</a>, I just could not stomach it. When working in a GUI, sorry but I need at least decent multi-file support with tabs, Ctrl-N to quickly create a scratch file, and of course my Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V and common GUI shortcuts; gvim&#8217;s UI is at odds with everything else in the GUI world.</p>

<p>Then someone pointed me to <a title="Sublime Text 2" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a>. Great editor, lots of tools, features, and neat details. Works on Windows, Mac and Linux. Supports the notion of projects. Scriptable in Python, awesome! I have been using it on and off for a while to see if I really want to switch to it. It is a commercial product, and I suspect that some of the old ghosts with rectangular block selections and Find in Files will come back and deter me from ST2, but for now I&#8217;m enjoying it. I wrote a little plugin to add basic Perforce integration:</p>
