      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, Adobe released to the masses a new version of their Flash Player, and an updated SDK. The biggest change (for me at least) is the inclusion of hardware-accelerated 3D, known as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/stage3d.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Stage3D&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s a quick tour of what I did to compile and run my first Stage3D program (Windows 7 PC but should be applicable everywhere). Useful because the Adobe site is not really clear about this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Time for that old laptop to receive Ubuntu 11.04!
Er…
Apparently, the graphics card is too old to run the fancy new Unity UI. Ah well, in any case, it’s a good idea to have a working Linux machine.
Then, the same problem as before. And I hate myself for not detailing precisely what I did to speed up the HDD. I need to fix this ASAP because the system has started doing massive checks to update packages and the machine is completely unusable.</description>
