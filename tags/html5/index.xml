      <title>Firedemo 20th anniversary</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been nearly 20 years since we released that old fire effect and the demoscene turned out to love it. I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.iguanademos.com/Jare/files/Fire/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ported it to HTML5&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started when we bought a math coprocessor for our &lt;sup&gt;386&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; and I started playing with fractals and plasmas. A few programming mistakes later, this thing came out and looked neat, so we slapped JCAB&amp;#8217;s VT player and released it. Eternal gratitude to Jester of Sanity for unknowingly lending me his fantastic &lt;a href=&#34;http://mod.haxor.fi/Jester/mod.elysium&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&amp;#8216;Elysium&amp;#8217; mod&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; it didn&amp;#8217;t take me long to learn that such acts were VERY badly frowned upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/TheJare/FiredemoHTML5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;source code on github&lt;/a&gt; if you are so inclined. The comments are slightly better this time! This version runs rather slowly on Chrome, and I don&amp;#8217;t really know why, but IE, Firefox (Win and Android) and iOS Safari work great.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SpainJS</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had the honor to give a presentation at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://spainjs.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SpainJS&lt;/a&gt; Javascript conference in Madrid, on the topic of Videogames and Javascript. I wasted a lot of time preparing a dynamic HTML5 page for my deck of slides, which was my excuse to play with CSS 3d transitions and fancy formatting. You can see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://iguanademos.com/Jare/docs/html5/SpainJS2012/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dynamic deck&lt;/a&gt; (which needs Chrome/Firefox or a similarly decent browser), the &lt;a href=&#34;http://iguanademos.com/Jare/docs/html5/SpainJS2012/#all&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;static deck&lt;/a&gt; (should work everywhere), a &lt;a href=&#34;http://iguanademos.com/Jare/docs/html5/SpainJS2012/spainjs.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; I converted using &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/wkhtmltopdf/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wkhtmltopdf&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://speakerdeck.com/u/thejare/p/overview-of-javascript-in-games&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Speakerdeck&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4JmYAVjm1c&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Colors!</title>
      <link>https://thejare.github.io/2011/12/colors/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our little one loves to grab anything shiny, but is especially attracted to LCD screens of any type. He loves the netbook, the MacBook, my desktop&amp;#8217;s dual monitors, and of course the big TV, but most of all he loves the iPhone. I often activate the camera in reverse mode and let him play with it, but there&amp;#8217;s always been a problem: while he manipulates the phone, he will push some control or other and stop the camera, go to the desktop and start pushing random icons. I was wishing for some sort of &amp;#8216;baby mode&amp;#8217; where something neat would be happening on the screen, but controls would be disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to use the Sunday morning to dust off my Canvas, CSS and JavaScript skills to code, with Alba&amp;#8217;s design input and feedback, a little BabySaver that could keep his attention with bright colors, and be impossible to quit for him. &lt;a title=&#34;Colors BabySaver&#34; href=&#34;http://www.iguanademos.com/Jare/temp/html5/BabySavers/Colors/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to see its current form. Click on the &amp;#8220;Endless&amp;#8221; button to enable interactions, otherwise any clicks will take you to my homepage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion? He is much more interested in the iPhone&amp;#8217;s back, the plastic cover, and trying to eat them, than in watching the flying colors. And he still manages to open the iOS Notification Center pull-down, and from there go to the Message Center or some other app, in effect leaving the BabySaver. In typical &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;we know better than you&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; Apple style, the pull down can&amp;#8217;t be disabled, not even inside native apps or as a global configuration setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, getting the CSS and scaffolding to work properly across browsers (including mobile Safari) was much more time consuming than programming the actual effects. Particularly disturbing was when the iPhone didn&amp;#8217;t like the &amp;#8216;Style&amp;#8217; button in the upper left corner: it worked fine in the beginning, but after adding the other buttons and the button style, it became unclickable (almost! With lots of trying, I could manage to click it). I have no idea why, and I couldn&amp;#8217;t figure out how to revert this behaviour. This, along with the Notification Center issue, is the reason the buttons are at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t tried it on any Androids or Windows Phones, but I have high hopes. Now that all the boring pieces are in place I&amp;#8217;ll probably try to write more effects and sounds to see how he likes them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback is welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
