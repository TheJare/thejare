                            The good news is that Soul Calibur 2 Xbox is among the new batch of gamessupported by the 360 emulator. The bad news is that only the US version does. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I know that my brother and the other Ninjas keep working their asses to make this stuff happen, but sometimes I think I’m jinxed. I’ve never been much into fighting games, but the Soul Calibur was uniquely awesome and still my favourite.

                            After all the jabs that Sony threw on Microsoft for being unable to play ALL XBox games in its 360 backcompat emulator, someone decided to check how Sony’s efforts are much better. This video is the result, and does create serious doubts that anyone will want to play their PS2 games on a PS3. If they work at all, that is, because Sony has a list and even a database of their own.

                            My 2 sisters and my parents never really understood my brother’s and my own fixation with videgames. They mostly accepted it, understood it was something that we enjoyed, and at some point they were happy that we made successful (even if a bit rollercoaster-like) careers out of it. The closest thing they got to enjoying a videogame was watching me play Ico.
Marta was sometimes curious about some games when she was much younger, but since then she kind of felt that videogames were a terrible way to waste one’s spare time.

                            So, Scott Miller thinks Valve is not a good route to follow, with quotes like &ldquo;I’m not a big fan of using Steam, because I’m not a fan of a strong competitor of ours having access to our download stats and revenue totals.&quot; or &ldquo;if Valve doesn’t do well for a game or two, Steam will get cut before their internal game development&rdquo;. Then, the same day, Prey gets released on Steam.

                            I finally had a few hours to sit down and play the game through to the end. It is verygood, probably the shooter I’ve enjoyed the most since the original Halo. The technology is brilliant, the levels and firefights are very well designed, and the production is fantastic. It’s a lot of fun to play, and brings a fresh approach to the genre. It takes a while getting used to the controls, movement and cover-based fighting, but the first Act does a good job of teaching you all of that without being too easy.

                            Some people have emailed me to ask if &ldquo;what they have heard&rdquo; is true. Yes, it is: this Christmas I will be leaving Pyro Studios. Unlike other veterans, I’m staying in the games industry; I have already accepted a job offer outside of Spain, which means I will be doing a lot of packing in a couple months.
Leaving the company at which I have worked hard for the past eight years was a hard decision, but in hindsight it was inevitable.

                            I just came back from having dinner with Enric Alvarez, the CEO of Mercury Steam and currently hard at work on Clive Barker’s Jericho. We shared a roundtable a couple weeks ago in Art Futura, but didn’t have much time to talk there. Great food and even better conversation. Although it’s not been easy for such a small studio, they seem to be doing a great job transitioning into the fabled next-gen.
