                            Hey! Yeah I&#8217;m still alive, and so is the site. For some reason, posting here got completely sidetracked, I guess I just ended up doing my &ldquo;social updates&rdquo; via Facebook instead. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s going to really change, so no promises. Whew, 2009 flew by and what a great year it was. Then 2010 came with some surprises early on: Activision laid off my entire team at Radical. I was already considering coming back to Spain after finishing the project, so this just sped things up.

                            I recently watched Coraline, a charming fairytale. I was mildly excited to see it in 3D and find out what all the craze was about. Back in the 80&#8217;s I watched Jaws 3D using the same technology, and being less than impressed after the first 3 or 4 gimmicks. The result? I liked Coraline but didn&#8217;t enjoy the experience. I found the 3D distracting at times, and generally tiring. This article describes many of these symptoms and possible causes much better than I can try.

                            Happy New Year! The Universidad Complutense team is organizing a Game Jam in Madrid around the end of January 2009. Check it out! It&#8217;s the same people who organized the Master in Games Programming with which I collaborated as a tutor a few years ago, so I know you will be in good hands. (thanks Bak, I had totally missed this one) &lt;&gt; By the way, the movie The Spirit is one of the worst movies I&#8217;ve ever seen.

                            I&#8217;ve been playing lately: LEGO Batman: Just like all the other LEGO games. Funny, forgiving and with tons of stuff to do on the side. I love the idea of playing the missions from the point of view of the heros and then the villains. Braid: Irritating but creative and ultimately very rewarding. Most of the puzzles have relatively easy to execute solutions, but they can be hard to figure out, while the more obvious solutions are jolly hard to do.

                            After the Activision Blizzard merger thing, a lot of people have been laid off at Radical Entertainment, but thankfully I&#8217;m not one of them. I wish the best of lucks to those who are no longer in the company, and I hope they land on their very capable and knowledgeable feet. When the final details of the layoffs were announced, I was on holidays in Alaska. It&#8217;s weird to be hiking, trying to catch sight of a bear or moose, and generally having a great time, while you know that at that precise moment you may be losing your job.

                            The Diablo 3 announcement got my loot-whore juices flowing again. Loot in WoW is a grind to get, Titan Quest hadn&rsquo;t done it for me, AoC didn&rsquo;t even register, Robokill is nice but small, and I am fighting the urge to buy the Diablo 2 battlechest. But then I remembered that the Too Human demo was coming out soon. Today, in fact. I like what they were trying to do with the game, I like it a lot.

                            Age of Conan came out, a promising MMO from veterans Funcom. It promised gore, nudity, great graphics and a few twists to the classic MMORPG genre. Even though it delivered in those areas, the game is way too buggy, unfinished and, well, unpolished. I reached level 43 and stopped playing. As a developer, I can endure normal bugs, but there&#8217;s just not enough variety in the game to make me want to play further.

                            It&#8217;s been a while since I updated this, so let&#8217;s at least recap a few movies I&#8217;ve seen lately. From better to worse: In Bruges: Unique film full of strange situations and unforgettable characters and dialog. Despite being so weird, it still manages to be very entertaining. Charlie Wilson&#8217;s War: interesting characters and excellent dialogs in a very entertaining and thought-provoking movie. Very good acting except for Julia Roberts, who for some reason is not believable at all in her role.
