                            This is a trip down memory lane! Jet Pac Reloaded is now available for download in XBox Live Arcade. For those not insanely old, Jet Pac was an 8-bit game released sometime around 1982. I played it on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, and it&#8217;s a very dear game to me for several reasons. This is the game that distinctly made me want to make games. I was 12 years old, but I used to say &ldquo;someday I will make a Jet Pac&rdquo;.

                            Will Wright gave a keynote speech at the SXSW conference. i had never heard of it, but if Will was there, it can&#8217;t totally suck. 🙂 3pointD has a fantastic transcription. I&#8217;ll keep at least one quote: &ldquo;Movie: What’s going to happen next? Games: Can I accomplish this?&rdquo; He also mentions Groundhog Day and Truman Show, both of which are extremely popular among gamers, because they speak about the world in terms that any gamer will recognize.

                            He really is. And if someone gets offended by this opinion, perhaps I will apologize. Maybe. I find it hard to get over the fact that for all his blahblah about who is doing what for the industry, he has never shipped a finished game. Fucking clown. In other news, I&#8217;ve been in Vancouver for over a week now. The relocation process is going quite smooth. Even with the rain, I love the city and all it has to offer.

You can check <a href="http://faq.eu.playstation.com/bc/" target="_blank">here</a> for the list of PS2 titles confirmed to work on the European PS3.

                            Late last year, I accepted a job offer from Radical Entertainment, and I will be moving to rainy Vancouver next Monday. The past month has been quite busy with preparations, spending time with friends and family, and yes, playing World of Warcraft as well. The arrangements for the move have been fairly smooth thanks to Radical&#8217;s fine HR crew Nicole and Marc (good luck in Google!). I expect to do a lot more hands-on programming there than I have been able to during the past years.

                            <p>The Burning Crusade, World of Warcraft&#8217;s first expansion pack, is out, and presumably, 8 million subscribers will be buying it in the next few weeks. As far as numbers go, it should become the fastest selling videogame in history. Aside from a few bugs and the expected server overloads / crashes, the launch seems to have gone quite smoothly, and most people are loving it (me included!). It is more of the same polished and playable gameplay and content, don&#8217;t expect any radical changes.</p>

                            Gamasutra has posted a commented reproduction of the Call of Duty: Their Finest Hour development contract between Sparks Interactive and Activision. This document was made public as part of the legal battle between the two companies. It contains everything: clauses, obligations, warranties, assignment of rights, dates and payments, royalties, key team members &#8211; the whole shebang. Three lawyers comment the details of each section, and what problems they think could arise in the future.
