                            Will Wright chatted with Wired, and participated in an E3 panel. Great stuff in both articles.
I went to watch Star Wars: Episode III &#8211; Revenge of the Sith, and was pleasantly surprised! While the two prequels had been visually amazing, the story, dialogue and character development seriously lacked. Episode 3 &#8211; RotS is different: the story is really good, and it certainly has the darker tone that Lucas had promised.

                            The first battle, in what will hopefully be a long war, is over. Both have given their first presentation, and Sony has completely stolen the show. Why? Because they have shown a lot of cool stuff and Microsoft hasn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s why. At the moment theres a certain feeling that Sony has Dreamcasted the XBox 2 (I refuse to call it 360).
Most of the videos are pre-rendered clips, and for those that are in-game footage, when you see the screenshots you notice a lot of tricks which you know will lessen the sense of photorealism and detail.

                            If you only ever watch one classic movie (those filmed in black and white, before you were born), you won&#8217;t go wrong if you choose All About Eve. Amazing script, great performances and witty dialogue&#8230; it really is one of the best movies ever made.
Interesting interview with Paul Verhoeven (from 2002). I really enjoy the unique view of the world he creates in his movies (I even found Showgirls not that bad!

                            Gave my lecture at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid, and the slides (in Spanish) are available here.
I&#8217;m not terribly happy with the way the lecture went. To begin with, there were very few attendants; Friday afternoon right before a long weekend with sunny weather? Even I was anxious to hit the road and get to the beach! I also felt that the students were more curious that truly interested in professional and philosophical games development issues.

                            Their current argument over the encryption system in Nikon&#8217;s Raw file format is pretty funny. In the past, Adobe has been just as protective about their own format: Adobe&#8217;s font formats were not open, and the Photoshop SDK stopped being freely available around version 7. So, I am the happy owner of two Nikon digital cameras, I dislike unnecessary protection / encryption systems, Photoshop is an amazing piece of software, and my experiences with Adobe&#8217;s tech support people have been horribly bad.

It was bound to happen, sooner or later, but it is still shocking to see it materialized. I have never been interested in buying online properties, since I assume that acquiring them in the game is one of the main reasons for playing in the first place. Playing a MMO has to be fun in itself, but as we know already, fun is a dish with many ingredients.
So, rather than find my own stance among all the moral, ethical, emotional, rational debates about the meaning of this, I&#8217;ll be realistic about my assumptions, and simply sit back and see what happens.

                            Looks like the people at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid haven&#8217;t got tired of me yet, and have invited me to give a lecture by the end of April. Details here: http://www.fdi.ucm.es/local/eventos/index.html.
In the lecture I try to explore four key areas of videogames as a professional career: the business side, the engineering (the lecture is for their Computer Science campus), entertainment, and the value of games as art. Broad topic!
