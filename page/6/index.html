                            It&#8217;s out, and it&#8217;s fantastic! Finishing the game is relatively easy even for old farts like me, but the point of the game is killing with style, variety and effectiveness. The game&#8217;s biggest flaw is that it repeats a lot of content, but it doesn&#8217;t feel too repetitive to me because it&#8217;s the fun of fighting that matters. They pulled off a tough feat when more than half of the game is played with a new character instead of our beloved Dante, and that character doesn&#8217;t suck!

                            A few monhts ago in Gamasutra, Harvey Smith described the intriguing elements of social and political subversion in his shooter Blacksite: Area 51. The game apparently turned out to be crap, but I never got to try it. Now Gamasutra again introduces us to another contender for &ldquo;politically conscious FPS games&rdquo; in the form of Turning Point: Fall of Liberty. From the horrible demo just released, this game is even worse.

                            JJ Abram&#8217;s latest baby is here, after months of speculation generated by last summer&#8217;s trailer and an Internet viral campaign. It&#8217;s basically a Godzilla-like monster movie shown through the eyes of a guy&#8217;s camcorder. There are many reports of people feeling sick and even throwing up thanks to the savage shaky-cam work. I certainly saw way more people getting up and out of the theater than in any other movie I remember (except for Vatel, but that&#8217;s a different story).

                            And a happy New Year to everyone! It&acute;s good to be in Spain for a couple of weeks, see the family, friends, and of course have plenty of tapas and fun. Yesterday I went to watch Michael Clayton, an excellent directorial debut by writer Tony Gilroy. He was clearly influenced by producer Steven Soderbergh&#8217;s style: slow pace, complex storytelling and heavy emphasis on character development. One of the best movies this year.

                            Ok, this is really cool. Passage is a sort of artsy-fartsy game that&#8217;s supposed to make you think and all that, rather than entertain. Jokes aside, it is a really interesting experiment. It&#8217;s not pretty, it&#8217;s not even fun, but it certainly touches some of the ways in which a game can speak about us, both the author and the players. You should play it without reading any instructions, just&#8230; well, like creator Jason Roher says, fire it up and play it.

                            Some good stuff coming from there, but from all the coverage I have had access to, this talk by Jonathan Blow is the most interesting (and complete &#8211; audio and slides included). A bit incomplete in the sense that it doesn&#8217;t address the need for commercial games to work as commercial products, but commercial viability is not his point anyway. For some time I have held the belief that games have a hard time as meaningful forms of expression, because the kind of activity and instant-to-instant attention they require tends to overwhelm the mind and distract from what could be meaningful in them.

                            The beta is out, so I dusted off my test project and checked it out. The transition was fairly painless, and the great news is that it works with Visual Studio 2005. No more of that Express crap! (to be fair, VC# Express is quite good for the price) I was curious about the Content Pipeline stuff since I had never touched it before, so I set out to prepare a custom Model processor that would extract more detailed material parameters from the source art, including a property to specify a specific fx shader / effect.
