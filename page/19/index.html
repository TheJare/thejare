                        Yeah, hum&#8230; I&#8217;m not calling it the XBox 2 anymore, and I even bought one a couple weeks after release. ðŸ™‚ &#8211; XBox Live Arcade positively rocks. I tried to approach it as a dumb user, and found that the menus are not simple, but they are consistent, so once you get the hang of them, anyone should be comfortable. The ability to download game demos, trailers and such is great, now all it needs is more more more content.

                        It&#8217;s great, useful and&#8230; I have always had some dark thoughts about it, which Penny-Arcade has pretty much summed up in their unique style: &ldquo;What you&#8217;ve proposed is a kind of quantum encyclopedia, where genuine data both exists and doesn&#8217;t exist depending on the precise moment I rely upon your discordant fucking mob for my information.&rdquo; With the heated debates going on about its updated procedures, policies, goals and fundraising, it&#8217;s hard to see it growing in significance beyond what it currently offers.

                        Version 0.2 of the little C# game can be downloaded here. It has a little bit of AI, enough to make the game, if not truly challenging, at least much more interesting. I have also included a Release version which shouldn&#8217;t require Visual Studio 2005 installed, and links to the necessary runtimes. I get reports that it still fails to run in some machines &#8211; I have no idea why. Can someone help with this?

                        Every now and then, I experiment with C# and the .NET Framework. For the most part, it&#8217;s an amazingly useful environment to develop on; you can crank up tools and interfaces in no time, and Visual Studio provides lots of helpers to improve productivity and general comfort. However, not all is rosy. Being a const-correctness fan, I dismayed when I found out about this. To quote from one of the comments: &gt; Mort just wants to get his job done.

                        The December DirectX 9 SDK has been released. It apparently includes some DX10 tech previews requiring unreleased hardware and the latest beta of Windows Vista. Ah, the joys of another version of the D3DX DLL&#8230; Edit: Oh yes another buggy installer from your favourite Software giant! A few seconds into the installation, it halted with an error because it couldn&#8217;t find some &ldquo;April 2005 SDK files&rdquo;. Then it started to rollback the installer, and then decided to continue installing anyway.

                        Due to popular demand (i.e. 3 of the 4 people who read this blog requested it, Trace being the last), I added a RSS 2.0 feed to the site. It can&#8217;t be viewed directly as XML in the browser because I don&#8217;t know how to make the server output that page typed as XML. Nothing serious I guess. I tested it with RSS Reader but I suppose people will complain that they want support for 0.9, or Atom, or whatever else.

                        Damn, this is bad news! Stainless Steel brought us Empire Earth, Empires, and were working on the absolutely gorgeous Rise and Fall. Although not my personal favourite RTS games, they were very well done and showed all the technical and artistic talent of the SSSI crew. I had the pleasure to meet Rick Goodman a few times, and it was apparent he loved his job and cared for his employees. Best wishes to Rick and all the SSSI developers, hope they land on their feet and deliver their talent in many top-notch games.

Are users being robbed of their (our) fundamental rights, or are companies simply exerting theirs? Is law really covering the topics, or are lawyers and companies merely abusing the system to build up power? This article is very interesting.
